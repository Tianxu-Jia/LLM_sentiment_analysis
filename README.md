# LLM_sentiment_analysis

In this repository, there are three kinds of sentiment analysis. They are normal glable sentiment analysis, context sentiment analysis and aspect sentiment analysis. Contextual sentiment analysis refers to sentiment analysis that takes into account the context surrounding a piece of text in order to better understand the sentiment being expressed. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) refers to sentiment analysis that looks at opinions and emotions towards specific aspects of products, services, topics, individuals, etc. rather than providing an overall sentiment score.
