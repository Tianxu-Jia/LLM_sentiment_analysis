0,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,2022-06-02,Mandy,UPDATED REVIEW - 5 months in,"I have been taking these gummies (along with their women‚Äôs multi vitamin) religiously for 3.5 weeks now. There isn‚Äôt a drastic difference yet, but I am seeing improvements and plan to wait a full 3 months for best results like others have mentioned.. For my background, I am a healthy 30 year old woman. No history of medical issues (aside from occasional low iron which I take vitamins for as well). 7 months ago I had COVID for about 8 days. I lost my taste and smell like most other people but that was about it. Fast forward about 3 months later, I started to notice that I was losing more hair every time I would shower (which is daily for my oily hair). It wasn‚Äôt large clumps at a time but it was definitely more than the usual 5-10 strands that I was used to. I thought at first that this was stress-related since I‚Äôve had a lot going on lately but then I started to notice that my hair texture had drastically changed to being thin and lifeless and the crown of my head and hair-part were really thin. I could see my scalp when I have never been able to see that before which started to scare me. By month 6 I was looking up every option to help.. At the beginning of May I started using the following:. - I take 2 of these vitamins once a day at night (both the hair vitamins and womens multi vitamin). - I kept up with my routine of taking iron pills because I‚Äôm anemic (this can also affect hair growth so I made sure to keep up with this - but DO NOT take iron supplements if you don‚Äôt need it as this can cause health problems for someone that doesn‚Äôt need iron supplements). -I started using Nioxin hair treatments (2% minoxidil topical treatments twice per day, massaged into my scalp in the morning and at night). - I started using Nioxin shampoo and conditioner every day. - and I started to use Redken extreme length sealer cream as a styling leave in conditioner before blow drying my hair. (All products mentioned are pictured with this review). After 3.5 weeks of this strict routine, I am starting to notice a difference and hope for continued growth. I will say, I am unsure which product is doing the trick for me but I am keeping up with the routine regardless because I am desperate for my old hair back.. Note: it‚Äôs worth mentioning that I‚Äôve been told that once you start a topical solution like Nioxin, you‚Äôll have to keep up with it otherwise your hair will start to fall out again like it did originally. It shouldn‚Äôt cause additional fallout, but it will essentially go back to where you started from what I‚Äôve heard. I‚Äôm not sure if this is a marketing scheme or if it‚Äôs true, so I‚Äôm just incorporating it into my routine from here on out- it‚Äôs honestly not that inconvenient once you‚Äôre used to it. Also if using any Minoxidil topical solution, be careful when applying the solution that you don‚Äôt get it on your face-unless you want facial hair.. I hope to post an update in 2 or 3 months. Thanks for reading my long review (sorry!) and good luck to anyone else going through this.. ***5-MONTH UPDATE*** I have been eating these gummies every night for 5 months now. I am happy to say that I have seen significant hair growth and my hair is much thicker again (no more bald spots on top of my head either). I stopped using the Nioxin after about 2 months of my routine because my hairline improved quickly and I wanted to see if I could take away that treatment and keep my results. Now, I am only taking the vitamins and my hair has grown about 6 inches in 5 months! My hair usually grows slow so this was a big deal for me. I also noticed that my nails are so much stronger than before, and my eyelashes seem to be thicker as well (I didn‚Äôt start to notice these benefits until about month 3 or 4 though). I haven‚Äôt had any skin issues like some people have posted, but everyone is different. I hope to continue these vitamins for the next 6‚Äì7 months and then I plan to provide a 1-year updated review.",5
1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,2020-04-23,Texas Jen,"This helped me slow down hair loss, but when I stopped talking it the hair loss returned.","They are a little expensive, but they seem to work. I'm on my 3rd bottle. I took first bottle thinking I'll try it... who knows. I didn't really see a difference at first.. I sit in my chair and have a habit of running my fingers through my hair getting rid of tangles when I am on the phone. Usually every time I end up having about 10-15 stands come out every time I comb through my hair with my hands to the point I was getting very concerned! Then shower after and as I'm shampooing and conditioning more would come out in my hands. Plus, I'd need to clear the drain several times to get water to drain and even after shower and after water had all drained go back and clear the rest of the hair out of drain.. I've always had very thick hair. I keep it below shoulders but above or at bra strap range.. So back to the first bottle. I had been taking them every day, and I was nearing 3 week and trying to decide if I should order another bottle and had decided not to waste the money. A few days later, I was chatting on the phone with my mom and running my fingers through my hair... like I do, and noticed only 2-3 strands of hair in my fingers each time. I was shocked. I kept running my hands through my hair and sometimes only 1 strand or none. I took a shower, least amount of hair in my drain than I've seen in a very long time!. So I ordered my second btl.. I wasn't as diligent about taking it daily and with this stay at home order where I live, different from shelter in place orders other states have, I got a little down and at a time where I should be upping all my supplement intake to keep my immune system healthy, I got down and wasn't taking much of anything.. I started noticing handfuls of hair coming out each time again. So I started back on my gummies about 2 week's ago and put in my order for my next bottle and received it yesterday.. So I haven't noticed thicker hair yet, but my hair didn't get down to half its thickness in just a month. It took a year and a half to really get thin.. I will say that it's already started slowing down the hairs I lose every time I run my fingers through it.. I did notice that my scalp is less visible when I'm styling it ( that I noticed after the first month I started taking them).. Biotin and folic acid are very important to hair and growth. But what is also important to know is B vitamins work together. So this product contains 5B vitamins (B6,B9,B12,B7, and B5).. The only thing I wish they would remove is the blue coloring. I usually attempt to stay away from food colorings. I mean who cares what color it is as long as it works. Plus I prefer not to have extra toxic ingredients, and I would love if they added all the B vitamins.. I'm going to finish my second bottle and start my third with no long gaps this time to see how things go, but in the interim I'm also going to look for a good liquid B complex as well.. Just a side note if you didn't already glean this little tidbit of knowledge from my long winded review, when you stop taking these you will go back to losing your hair.. It's not a one time quick fix! However, that is with everything in life. You stop eating junk food for a month, you feel great and lose weight and have more energy and are healthier for those changes and choices made. You go back to eating junk and you go back to where you were before.. Any healthy changes you choose to make in your life you will need to continue in order to keep seeing results.. I hope this helps anyone that has a bit of time on their hands to read it. üòÅ. Clearly I had a bit of extra time on my hands to write it considering most of us are staying at home until we can return to work.",5
2,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,2023-02-08,Marlice Perez-Rivera,"The hype is real, I stand corrected","For so long I never bought these because I didn‚Äôt want to support the kardashians financially since they promoted it often, however now years later, I tried it and I love it. A family friend who went to cosmetology school, and hair school, recommended these to me after I told her that ever since I cut my hair super short in college I feel like my hair doesn‚Äôt grow pst a certain length anymore. I started taking these and my lashes are fuller and my brows are fuller! Best of all my hair is literally noticeably longer than it ever has been other than when I was a little girl. I didn‚Äôt want to believe it but it works. I will note that I have a sensitivity to biotin, but most HSN type of vitamins have biotin in them. Because of this I have the tendency to break out when taking anything with it as an incredibly even in the smallest amount. This is something I never was looking to ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù with other vitamins because they didn‚Äôt show much results and I would break out quite a bit, even on my back (I NEVER break out there). My break outs while taking sugar bear were not the worst, but I was getting more than one which I never do. I use a pretty consistent routine that otherwise leaves my skin pretty clear so I feel like I notice everything on my face. Will be repurchasing !",5

I‚Äôm an African American female who joined the natural hair community over 2 years ago. My hair texture is kinky coily 4C and wouldn‚Äôt grow past a certain length even with protective styles and natural oils. January 2018, I purchased these vitamins after doing my research and reading the reviews on here. I also changed my diet, eating more leafy greens and drinking more water and focused on skincare to avoid breaking out. I was shocked when I started seeing results after two weeks, not only was my hair growing longer, the sparse areas in my edges grew back and I had new hair growing around my hair line pushing it forward. My nails also grew and hairs on the other parts of my body both wanted and unwanted lol. My sister is my hair stylist and she too noticed my hair growth but convinced me it was my new diet and healthy lifestyle rather than the gummies, so I stopped taking them after February. Unfortunately, my hair stopped growing, my edges started getting sparse and my nails were not as strong. After 3 months with no progress, I repurchased the Sugar Bear Hair Gummies in June. I‚Äôm writing this review a month later and MY HAIR IS GROWING AGAIN!! This time I did have some break outs pop up during the first week but they went away and I haven‚Äôt had anymore show up. The only con I have is the price, almost $40 a month is adds up but I recommend you try it out. Sorry for the long review.",5

I quit taking them for awhile, hoping to find something of equal value, while stilll providing the same great taste and giving healing power to not only my hair, but also my skin and nails. WOW! This is it! I HAD to go back. After only TWO days back on them, I honestly experienced the most improvement in my skin over any other product I tried.. I recently pulled out a partially used bottle of Sugarbearhairhair vegan gummies because I had been noticing more-than-normal drying and flaking skin and hair and started using the gummies for just a couple of days when I noticed a drastic change in the smoothness and improvement in the feel and look of not only my hair, but of my nails and skin as well. I looked at the label on the Sugarbearhair gummies and read that the daily value of 260mcg (2 gummies) contains 108% folic acid! Now that is amazing! That was enough evidence for me to demonstrate the reason for the rapid improvement in the texture, look and feel of my hair, nails AND SKIN!. I recently completed a form at the doctor's office for a Medicare wellness exam and one of the questions on the forms asked if the patient (me) takes Folic Acid as a supplement. I looked at the bottle of Sugarbearhair gummies and read the label that stated 108% value in Folic Acid. I'm not really certain about how to interpret these values but it was enough",5

23,0,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,2018-02-23,Beth,So far...,"I will have to come back in 3 months to update my review. For now I give it 5 stars based on taste, ease of taking and ingredients. I won‚Äôt review based on results until I‚Äôve tried it at least 90 days. No one can really give an accurate review of a product like this for a few months. Taste: they are yummy. Can‚Äôt complain about that at all. Best part about the flavor is once you‚Äôre finished chewing & swallowing, the flavor pretty much goes away. It‚Äôs not a lingering flavor.. Ease of taking: yes, they are easy to chew. Very soft. Not rubbery like a gummy bear. However, they do tend to stick to your teeth. It‚Äôs not that bad. They dissolve fairly quickly so it‚Äôs very little that sticks.. Ingredients: It‚Äôs full of all the vitamins needed for healthy hair, skin, nails. Nothing to complain about there. For those that do complain about a couple of the extra ingredients like sugar & coloring, please stop. It‚Äôs not enough to make a difference. The gummies are small, and you only chew two daily. FYI.. #1 do NOT contain enough sugar to cause acne. Think about the other things you consume that contain before you blame the vitamins. #2 Please do a little research on the difference between micrograms (mcg) and grams (g). The Inositol is dosed in mcg on this label. It‚Äôs not even close to enough daily to cause a real problem. I think some people could have sensitivities to things, but I also believe the pics shown of people with massive acne breakouts are from people with acne prone skin anyway. I do not have acne on my face. I will be able to give an honest review of the product, if that should change. I doubt it will. Like I said the ‚Äúother‚Äù ingredients like sugar & inositol are not enough to CAUSE severe acne breakouts.. I will be back to update in May!. P.S. I had already been doing other things for my hair prior to starting the gummies. I wash my hair in a quality moroccan oil shampoo & conditioner and I use an argan oil heat protectant spray on my hair before using ANY heating tool whether it‚Äôs a hair dryer, straightener or curler. I threw away my brushes and ONLY use a comb. I don‚Äôt put my hair up wet. I don‚Äôt box color my hair anymore. In fact, I don‚Äôt dye my hair at all. I get it cut every 8 weeks. Once a week I use an argan oil mask. Once a month I use a vinegar rinse (Just Natural). Yep, I spend a lot of money, but the products last forever. My hair is healthier than it‚Äôs ever been. The gunmies were the final step. Oh, and I drink a ton of water. I do that anyway because I workout daily. I eat no sugar, no fried foods, no processed foods. You HAVE to take care of the inside as well as the outside of your body.",5

29,0,-1,-1,0,-1,0,-1,2018-09-29,sanaz_,"REVERSED years of stress-related hair thinning!!!!! Ladies, I am not making this up!!!!!!!!","First off, I never review products, and I would have never imagined myself to have such rave reviews for adult gummy vitamins. But I figured that as a 22-year old woman who has dealt with hair loss and thinning at the part for a majority of her teenage and young adult life, my experience with this product may be worth sharing. After a parent was diagnosed with a chronic illness when I was a teenager, stress and hair loss (and stress because of hair loss, etc.) had become a normal part of my life. Countless doctor appointments, hair specialist visits and blood tests had ruled out the possibilities of allergic reactions, genetic disorders, and hormonal imbalances. It wasn't until my general practitioner finally mentioned that the causes were likely stress and nutrition-related that I started doing research into vitamins to treat my deficiencies, and boy, am I glad I did. Soon after, I came across SugarBearHair--which I recognized from the plethora of promotions made by the Kardashian clan and other celebrities--and quite frankly, I was skeptical about its legitimacy. But by this point, I was at my wits end after years of treatments and finding no real results, so I figured I would give this a try for at least one month.... I am not exaggerating when I say that the results have been FANTASTIC. In the last month, I have received comments from my hairstylist, hair loss specialist and family about my hair regrowth. My hair looks fuller now than it has in years, with thick hair regrowth on the back of my head. I can also see my thinning part beginning to slowly fill out. To say that I am RELIEVED AND ASTONISHED would be an UNDERSTATEMENT. It should also be noted that I am using this product in combination with other vitamins, Spironolactone and birth control pills targeted at preventing hair loss, as well as better managing my stress, sleep, exercise and diet. However, it is also worth mentioning that it wasn't until a few weeks AFTER I started taking SugarBear that I starting seeing real results. I just started bottle two, and I don't intend to stop. Fingers crossed the results will keep coming. To all the young ladies out there experiencing hair thinning: PLEASE PLEASE 1) manage your stress, diet, sleep, and overall health; and 2) TAKE YOUR GUMMIES!",5

I‚Äôve had naturally curly, very thick hair, and super strong, fast-growing nails my entire life, always have gotten compliments on my hair and my nails and as silly as it sounds, wished my hair was thinner because it was SO much to deal with. As I‚Äôve gotten older (I‚Äôm 30 at the time of writing this) my hair has thinned out. After my second child was born almost seven months ago.. My hormones took over and my hairline was visually receding like a grown man‚Äôs. My fingernails were never affected and have remained strong and beautiful, but my face and scalp dried out extremely bad and my hair was just falling out excessively. I couldn‚Äôt put my hair up anymore and did everything I could to hide my bald spots. I cried everyday. My doctor told me eventually my hair should start growing back but it takes time. I‚Äôve had friends who have had this problem and their hair NEVER grew back so I was mortified remembering how little hair my grandma had when she died at age 65. I was hesitant on trying these because I‚Äôve heard gummy vitamins don‚Äôt absorb as well but I was willing to try anything to get my hair back. It‚Äôs a 6 week difference between these pics. My nails never took a hit but they‚Äôre growing even faster than normal and even my skin dryness has improved a little. My main concern was my hair.

Along with my recovery, I did adapt to a hair care routine and took safety precautions such as washing my hair 1-2x a week, sleeping with a satin bonnet every night, applying detangler/leave in spray conditioner after washing my hair, not wrapping your hair in a towel, not using a hair dryer, applying hair growth biotin to my scalp to boost the results. I take photos of my hair growth every month, within the 1st month, my hair was healthier, softer and stronger, after 3 months, I do see a huge difference in length.

I would go tanning in tanning beds just to try to dry out the pimples or it would just make my face darker which I felt hid my acne..(it actually just was damaging my skin even more and causing me more oily breakouts)..as much as I knew tanning was awful for me.. it was the one thing that I felt helped( although it really didn't!) I started taking sugar bear hair two months ago.. I can't say my skin was awful before taking them because it wasn't.. it wasnt great either.. but ever since I began taking these delicious gummies.. I swear I rarely get a pimple!!! My forehead I so smooth and clear along with the rest of my face. Bottom line.. these things are delicious.. I would eat a handful if I could. I figured they were just a fluke ad that everyone posts on instagram.. but I'm telling you.. it really works. I have longer hair to start but I have noticed stronger and thinker hair. I mainly take them for my skin now that I have found out how amazing they are. I read reviews of people saying that you shouldn't take them if you have acne prone skin but believe me ..everyone is different.. it might just work for you like it has for me!",5

My hair got a lot thicker and fuller I couldnt really tell if it grew faster or not but im satisfied with the length as well. 2. Hair that stopped growing 3 years ago started growing again, this I did not expect! Very happy with this. 3. The reviews that write about acne as a side effect are spot on, I never get acne but after taking these I noticed my face started getting dry skin and a few spots of acne breakouts, its totally managable though because after 2 days of a moisturizer that went away. It started coming back again so im going to have to use the product again to treat it. If you want your hair to grow thicker and your front hairline to possibly grow back again I highly reccomend these. The tradeoff for thicker hair for manageable acne is definitely worth it imo. Just get acbe treatment in advance.",5

It recommends 2 a day I take 1, I have been out now 2 wks so I gotta order again before I start shedding like my 3 cats, that is one thing I noticed, my hair is not falling out when I comb it after shower.

So believe me when I say with all honesty, I just finished my first bottle (I got the 3 month supply because your system doesnt take some time to adjust and if you want something that works and lasts, you will never get anything that will give you what you want over night.. I have literally tried EVERHTHING. Straight biotin and more.. But for starters, first off my nails have never grown this evenly, quickly or have ever been this strong. Ever. My family are the toughest cridicts and even they noticed (whaaaa) lol. Second, I have daily extream anxiety and stress and to be honest I am not a stranger to depression, so when my hair got as thin as it was I really thought there was something wrong with me... After a slight change in diet (just eating a little better) and taking this, ONE MONTH my hair is 2 inches longer and is looking healthier. It used to take a few months for it to grow an inch and a half.. It got really bad.. So my suggestion to you. If you want this to work, you should also try taking a bit better care of yourself on the insides. Most vitamins and supplements WONT WORK if your body can't process them. Learned this the hard LOOOONG way as well.. I reccomend it, and wish you all the best.",5

I have been taking these vitamins for about 6/7 weeks. Which means I am on my second bottle and I also think I now have a solid review:. PROS:. 1) The taste is AWESOME! They are very soft and delicious, like a fruity gummy snack. Honestly hard to eat just the recommended 2!. 2) My nails have never been stronger. They grow insanely fast and do not break (maybe a tiny tear in a corner but nothing a nail file cant fix) I must also add that I am very rough on my nails. They are also shiny and the tips are very opaque and white (normally the tips of my nails are flimsy and see through). 3) My hair seems to be growing faster. I can usually get away with not coloring my roots for up to 8 weeks but right around 5 weeks it was looking BAD! I would say my normal hair grows just over 1/2 inch per month and now its growing 1/2 inch in about 3 weeks. My opinion is you will see results but nothing like the pictures you see on instagram where you see girls' hair growing 2 inches in a month.. CONS:. 1) Body hair will also grow faster. For some reason I think my armpit hair is growing the fastest lol but my eyebrows have also filled in more than usual (this can be a PRO for some ladies with sparse brows) I did not notice any improvement in eyelashes. 2) The price is a little high but I have never seen such great results for my nails from a vitamin so it might be worth it to some people.. Overall, great product. I think it delivers what it says it will deliver. Personally, I will try it for one more month and see if I get any substantial hair growth and if not I will no longer place future orders.",5

For the past year I've been dealing with EXTREME breakage, to the point that I had to get bangs cut, which ALMOST ended up looking like a mullet. When I intentionally showed people the extent of the breakage, I was met with gasps, wide eyes, and hands over their mouths. I needed something to help grow out my hair as fast as possible.. I've had the vitamins for about three months now. Now, I'm really bad with routines, so for the first two months I took them on and off, probably only about 2-3x a week. However, in the last month I hunkered down and started taking them daily, and I honestly cannot believe the results. I'd say my hair has grown about an inch or more in that month. The new growth is extremely smooth and soft--such a difference compared to the chemically treated hair. And hair isn't just growing faster, but thicker. I didn't think that I had a problem with thickness before, but now my hair looks so thick and dark I can barely see my scalp.. I'm Native American, and long, healthy hair is almost a status symbol, but I've never been able to grow out my hair past my ribs before needing a serious cut. Well, with these babies, I have no doubt I'll be the envy of the family by Christmas. You'd have to pry them from my cold, dead hands to stop me from taking them.. Oh, and they taste pretty bomb too. Which is almost a negative, since you only get to take two of them a day. They're my morning treat!. I bought these on my own, and I'm not getting paid for this review. I'd like to, though.

I read all the reviews about getting acne from them and whatnot. I decided to try them anyway. I am so happy I did. My nails were SO thin before these gummies. I could literally tear them. My thumb nails kept splitting down the middle and I would constantly be bending my nails backwards (like, halfway up my nail and causing it to bleed and bruise). I started taking these almost two months ago and my nails have almost completely grown out, so the thin and cracked part is almost gone. My hair has also been improving. I have thin, straight hair. I was losing so much hair that my hubby wouldn't let me shower without a hair catcher because the drain had to be cleaned out every other day or so. It was bad. Since I've been using these, my shedding has decreased dramatically. It's amazing. I genuinely recommend these gummies. I got two pimples when I first started taking them, but I was taking both at once. I started taking one in the morning and one in the evening and I haven't had a problem since. Everyone's skin and bodies are different, so my honest opinion is to try them for at least a month (if not longer) and if you do get acne, just see if your body gets used to it.",5

Month-after-month of reading the reviews for this product, I finally went for it and I purchased a bottle. It arrived July 10, 2020. I read the instructions and immediately started the process. My hair stops (without my bending my neck) pass my shoulders. My hair was longer than that length until I got a little sassy and started the bleach streaks here-and-there. Of course my doing that caused some breakage. Long story short, I had gone to the nail salon and the technician of more than 20 years of service says ""did you do something different to your hair b/c it looks LONGER for some reason""...I replied it does...I am scheduled for a relaxer next week (got the relaxer today)...my stylist said you got a lot of NEW GROWTH...I didn't really know if this product would work for black women...it DOES! I thank God I have not had any negative reactions to theses vitamins. I can tell the difference in my hair texture and yes, it has grown in that short time span. Keep in mind every person's experience is NOT the same; although, there may be similarities in reviews but you'd have to try it for your self.

I was forced to cut a lot as an attempt to remove all the damage but without pretty much chopping it off the cut could only have so much success. I have been taking biotin, which seemed to help but after subsititing with these I have noticed drastic results.. I have been taking these for just under 3 weeks now, and although many people reported it taking months for results, my hair has already grown almost an inch and half! Yup that's right, less than 3 weeks! And I'm not even done with the month yet. I've also noticed my hair is silkier and less frizzy. I don't know how this is possible maybe it effects the oils of the scalp, I don't really care how it happened, but it did.. Now for the basics, I have not had any side effects taking these, other than my hair growth being everywhere lol, I usually do not have to shave my legs or underarms often but now I do. Also the taste isn't bad, sweet but not as amazing as in all the reviews but again not bad. I hate that they are pricy, but they work as well if not better than prenatal vitamins but without side effects. Ideally I'd love to take these regularly forever, but with the cost i don't know that I'd continue under normal circumstances.. Definitely worth a shot if you damaged your hair and need help restoring its glory, or you hair simply will not grow past a certain length..

I do not have long flowing locks, but noticed my hair growing longer and fuller after continued use of this product.. SugarBearHair Vitamins is a SUPPLEMENT; it SUPPLEMENTS your hair. It is not some ancient protected formula, crafted from strains of Repunzel's hair and the blood of Helen of Troy, which will transform you from Larry David to Harry Styles overnight. It, as all SUPPLEMENTS, require strict adherence to the instructions for the allotted time. Oh, and by strict, I mean eat two of those delicious little bears once a day.. As for a testimonial, which obviously may vary from person to person because we are all special little snowflakes and your hair is not exactly like mine, I have seen good results with continued and consistent use of SugarBearHair Vitamin. I naturally have thick, wavy hair. When I supplement it with the Bears, it becomes noticeably even more thick and curly. I started noticing my time between haircuts was shortening, as my hair was lengthening! Also, in regards to some reviews complaining of acne- I am extremely prone to breakouts, and have not suffered any complexion side effects from SugarBearHair. Trust me, if these cubs gave me any indication my face was going rogue and devolving to pizza face, I would immediately stop.. Bottom line, I followed the directions stayed consistent, and the Bears worked and continue to for me. My only complaint is I wish they didn't taste so delicious because I could easily take a 2 month supply to the face. Scoop up some Bears before your hair goes into hibernation.",5

After having an apparent identity crisis and dying my platinum blonde hair black, and then going back to blonde a month later, my hair was completely destroyed, breaking off, and thin. I hated washing my hair because it would come out in clumps. After using these for a month, I've noticed that it has completely stopped breaking off (other than a few strands coming out when I brush it). My hair has grown about an inch and become strong enough that it will not break anymore. Combined with taking extra care of my hair, not so much washing and heat styling, using deep conditioners, it is actually starting to look shiny and healthy again.. My hair has grown incredibly fast, not just on my head. These vitamins make body hair grow faster as well, so I've had to shave just about everyday. The only downside is that they made me break out for a while. I never get acne, and after about a week of using these, I started getting random zits on my face, mostly on my chin. But it seems that my skin is use to them now because I haven't had any issues since.. These vitamins are worth trying and definitely worth the money! They taste great, I find it much easier to eat two of these a day rather than swallowing a bunch of nasty pill supplements. Even my mom, who was skeptical of me ordering $30 hair vitamins on Amazon, tried one and asked me to order her a bottle.

Of course, when taking these vitamins you have to also take care of your hair. I chopped my hair, cut off all split ends, I do hair treatments, and I stay away from heat products and if I do use them ALWAYS use heat protection spray. Now the only downside which is also expected, is breaking out in the beginning but it‚Äôs normal because your body in simply trying to adjust to a new daily intake.

I'm a sucker for anything cute and bonus points if it's Tiffany Blue, so when I saw a few of my favorite accounts posting about these I had to at least check them out. It's basically a normal hair/skin/nails(biotin) vitamin, so nothing special in terms of ingredients. So, is this some miracle product that other vitamins can't rival? No. Is this a vitamin that is fun and tastes great? Yes. Is this a vitamin that makes taking them easy on someone who has trouble with pills? Yes. Is the product effective? Yes, if you know what to expect from biotin vitamins like these. Are my nails stronger? Yes. Does my skin look better? Yes. Is my hair growing faster? Time will tell (i""ve only been taking a few weeks and my hair is naturally slow growing as it is, though I have noticed new growth). I guess the last big question is: Is the price worth the effectiveness and novelty of the item? To me, yes. I love these and I will continue to buy them. But, for someone with a smaller budget, you can most likely find a more cost effective equivalent at your local Target - it just won't be as photogenic.",5

I didn't cut it and it had only grown about 3"" in that time. I stuck with this for a while and since the last update it has grown about 4"". Remember this does nothing for the already grown hair, this is to make your hair grow healthier. So one month is not going to give you results. But it's good to try the 1st month to see if you have any reactions to it. The hair closer to my scalp is thicker, due to the growth.. Update: 2/06/17. I read other reviews that indicated they had the same issues with breakouts. But a few pointed out that you have to DRINK WATER. Well at the time I wasn't much of a water-drinker. More of a coca-cola person. Since then, I've changed drinking habits and after reading the review I decided to give it another chance. Two weeks and no breakouts. My nails have grown significantly, the hair I have to give it more time.. DRINK WATER!!. Old review:. It did wonders for my nails, not sure about the hair, I only took 1 month. Unfortunatelly I started to break out after finally getting my acne routine to work for me within around two weeks of taking them. As soon as I stopped taking them it took about a week to clear back up. Have not taken them again.",5

I have tried many different brands of hair vitamins from generic to the more pricey variety. They all promise to do alot of things with my hair and lets just say the vitamins themselves for me were either difficult to take being in pill form or made me dizzy or nauseous to the point I stopped taking them (money wasted). I am proud to say I finished taking my first bottle of Sugarbear Hair Vitamins and plan on buying some more. Oh, I can't forget to comment on my hair growth, I recently went natural in January of this year and decided to get the rest of the relaxed ends trimmed off. The individual that cut my hair in my opinion was not experienced with natural hair and cut it uneven. I then had to go back to get it ""Corrected"" so needless to say I got about 8 inches cut off and had about 1/2 inch of growth left before taking the vitamins. as of right now my hair is long enough to put in CUTE little hair puffs :). The Sugarbear vitamins taste delicious and its really hard not to take more than two a day. I am ecstatic to see how long and healthy my hair looks in another year or so.",5

I was diagnosed with Alopecia Areata in October of 2017. I tried a variety of products for my hair loss, but to no avail. When I first started taking these vitamins in December of 2017 I had several developing bald spots. Some were extremely noticeable and hard to hide. I had heard A LOT of these amazing hair growth vitamins via social media, so I decided to give it a shot. I wasn‚Äôt confident that these would even help my autoimmune condition, but I figured there couldn‚Äôt be any damage in trying. After a couple months, BAM, my bald spots were ENTIRELY covered with new growth and my existing hair had grown quite noticeably considering I had chopped my hair off a few months prior. I‚Äôm not saying by any means that this product can cure Alopecia, or that it will work the same for individuals suffering from the same condition as I. However, I do know that they‚Äôve worked well for me and I will continue to buy them monthly. Not to mention how shiny and healthy my hair appears now!!

I have been washing my hair every other day, applying processed castor oil twice a week and using honey shampoo and conditioner. I believe everything has helped, but probably the vitamins have helped me the most. In my picture you‚Äôll see the difference in my hair line and the amount of hair I lost while brushing.

I posted pictures to help future shoppers make sure the product is genuine & original. According to Google, YouTube and many comments here, the package received, passes the test.. 1. The package has US official distribution info (fakes come from China).. 2. The bottles were sealed with plastic (fakes don‚Äôt have that).. 3. The Manufacturers info on the bottom should be like the one I posted (fakes will not have the same uniformed text).. 4. The seal is paper & aluminum (fakes only have aluminum).. 5. Color is like a light Tiffany blue (fakes are more green-ish teal with darker blue specs).. 6. Bears are distinct (fakes are less detailed and may have tiny holes throughout).. So there you have it!

I figured I'd try one bottle since a lot of reviews say they see a difference within 3-4 weeks. I'm sold! I have always had very fine thin hair and went on some awful meds a few years ago that really just destroyed my hair and made it super super thin. My hair just never bounced back. And I have tried everything! Nioxin, regular biotin, a combo of biotin and other vitamins, other special hair loss and thickening shampoos, nutriox vitamins, coconut oil, etc. Nothing ever seemed to really work. Until SugarBearHair... After about 3 days my hair already felt so much softer and healthier and insanely shiny (and my hair has always been fairly shiny but now it's insane!) I just started bottle #2 today, after 31 days my hair is fuller and thicker (I've been using X-fusion hair fibers as a filler for 2 years and haven't had to use it the past 2 weeks!!) and it's at least 1.5 inches longer. I will have to say during the first week I did get some bad breakouts around my chin. My skin is usually pretty good, but with some extra care it went away quickly, but totally worth it to see my hair magically transform!.

I think it's too soon if my hair is feeling thicker or anything BUT, the growth is crazy. I'm skeptical about sooooo many products. And I don't believe things actually work. But this.. I did a before and after picture and I'm impressed! My hair grows SO slow it's not even funny. I go get a trim and I swear it's like months before it grows back. Now the picture I posted when you first look at it it doesn't look different but if you look at where my hair is hitting on the words on the back of my shirt you can see the difference.

The fact that they're gummies makes it easy to stay consistent because I look forward to taking them every day. Taste wise they're fruity without being overly sweet. The texture is exactly the way you would expect gummy bears to feel. I'm just starting my second bottle but I have already seen a difference in my hair (I have very fine hair and tend to shed a lot). I didn't take any ""before"" pictures so I can't say exactly how much my hair has grown but I definitely notice a difference in length and shine. My hair is also fuller and thicker and isn't shedding as much as before. Additionally!, I've also seen a difference in my nails! Despite the fact that I bite my nails, I've still been able to notice that they have been growing back faster than before and are sooooooo shiny and much stronger! Overall, I'd recommend the s*** out of this product.. Some notes on my hair type:. *I have combo hair. It's mostly loose curls but some parts are tighter than others, some parts are straight. It's weird.. *Very fine and not full. *It's generally frizzy.. *Because of the weird hair texture I tend to straighten it a lot so I do have some damage as far is it being a bit brittle and dull.",5

They taste like candy and I love that it's a daily vitamin AND huge biotin dose in one. I used to have to take both separately which in gummy form, was not cheap. For me, this justifies the price.. My nails used to always rip and break and be ugly. Now they can grow long and are so much stronger than they used to be. As for hair, I haven't noticed a difference in thickness or strength, BUT my hair is definitely growing faster than it used to - which most people will love but I keep a short angled bob so I have to get it cut more often.. UPDATE: The company recently emailed me with a code for a FREE bottle for my participation in their surveys (and I'm assuming because I cancelled my subscription).

Some have been capsules, some have been gummies. One of the things I've had trouble with is being consistent in taking the pill/gummy each day.

Since I started using SugarBears 3 months ago, I can say I look forward to taking them everyday. I've noticed a difference in both my hair and nails (I'm a nail biter). My hair grew quite slowly before, so I'm able to see the Growth rate change easily in my roots.. If you are looking for a supplement in this category I'd recommend SugarBear for you. Some tips based on my observations:. 1) This is a daily supplement, not a 1 month quick fix - so use it for a couple months before forming an opinion. 2) I've read comments from people about their skin, in that case try taking 1 instead of 2 and see how that works. You are also probably not drinking enough water. 3) They are super delicious (best tasting vitamin I've had yet) so try taking them at night to curb sweet cravings. Hope this helps!",5

I have been taking them on and off for a few years, the problem is all the ones I have tried smell like regurgitated fish meal so it was a real chore choking them down. Often I would stop taking them for months at a time, till I noticed my nails becoming brittle and my hair losing some of its shine, then I would set an alarm on my phone and force myself to start taking them again.. I was a bit skeptical with SugarBear because of the price, but people said they were delicious so I thought I'd give them a try. Boy were they right. I actually look forward to taking them, they really do taste good, like really really good, like try not to eat the whole bottle good. With SugarBear vitamins there is no alarm needed!. So for all of these other reviews that say they are too expensive feel free to buy the cheap regurgitated fish meal that every other hair vitamin company is hawking, but I have one question. Is it really cheaper if you don't actually eat them? You can do what you want, but I know I'm never going back!",5

The second is that I cut my hair very, very short 6 years ago and haven't been able to grow it out past a certain point ever since. It would just start getting dead ends and have to be trimmed.

I took them for a few months and my hair did get longer. Then I stopped taking them for a few months, just to see if there was a difference, and now I've started taking them again. I did notice a difference when I wasn't taking them. They seem to work for me. I think it's the combination of the other vitamins and supplements in the gummies, instead of just the biotin.

Also, my skin is prone to breakouts so I just stopped taking hair vitamins all together. When I found out these vitamins were vegetarian I jumped at the chance to purchase. Although the price sucks, wee bit too expensive, Im on my second bottle. These pills, hands down, are the best tasting just as they claim. After a while the pills do taste a bit to sweet for me. I noticed very minor breakouts that were really small. In fact while on the pills I don't get huge pimples like I did prior. As for hair growth... Well I have a full blown afro so its a bit harder for me to tell. Personally I don't think my hair is growing any faster than normal but I do think it sheds less which for me is HUGE.

My hair is coming in healthy and my nails are strong. I'm in my 30s, so no breakouts, but my hair stylist mentioned that she did have an increase in acne when she took them (she's about 24).

The timing of the breakouts (after being acne-free for 10+ years) corresponds exactly to the day I began taking these supplements. THEY WORK. My nails are noticeably stronger already. They haven't grown out this long in years and years. Still too early to see much difference in my hair, but it should be the same as my nails ultimately. But due to the severity of the acne (im talking awful inflamed patches, peeling and angry), I'm going to stop taking them for now. If you take these, just be on the lookout for jawline acne problems.

I have to say a lot of the hype is about how great they taste. While it's important that they don't taste like road kill,it concerns me that if these cute little bears that taste like berry will fall into cute little hands that love the taste and take too much so be responsible if you have children and keep them stored as if you would store medicine.

2852,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2022-10-19,Ladybuggggs,My hair grows crazy slow and is frizz prone.,"After about a week I noticed my hair was getting oily and leaving a ‚Äúgrease‚Äù type feel on my fingers. My scalp never gets oily even if i dont wash my hair for a few days. THATS how dry my scalp and hair have always been. To see my scalp have an oilyness to it was strange to me. Washed as normal the next day and I also noticed that night it was also sorta oily. The ::following:: day I noticed my hair wasn‚Äôt as frizzy and i had a few ‚Äúgood hair days‚Äù in a row which is SUPER odd for me. Two weeks in my roots area was softer feeling and I noticed my edges looking a little darker and fuller. Since my hair hardly grows i cam go about six weeks at times before its time to color my roots. Im almost a month in and at week four I already had to color my roots. Which is something i never ever have to do in a 3-4 week period.. So far i have noticed a big improvement with the overall health of not only my hair, but my scalp and hairline.. I honestly think these gummies are helping. I also think they give a slight boost in energy as with a multivitamin would do. I plan on buying an additional box and gladly paying out of pocket for these. I would definitely check these out, as if i can see a difference with the first bottle alone, i can only imagine the boost of growth these vitamins are likely capable of getting my hair to grow.. The taste is ‚Äúokay‚Äù. They definitely dont taste ugly at all. The only complaint ihave is these gummies are like mushy a little. They leave a little blue in the crevices of my teeth lol. Swishing water and swallowing the drink takes care of that; lol. But again thats me TRYING to find something to complain about, lol.. Seriously, i am beyond excited about the second bottle. I definitely would suggest trying these out!!",5

2934,0,0,-1,0,-1,0,0,2022-10-04,Amber J,Pretty good gummy hair supplement so far  updated,"Update:. So I‚Äôve used an entire bottle and I can honestly say this is the best decision I have ever made for my hair. It‚Äôs shocking the difference this vitamin has made for my hair!! It‚Äôs silkier, smoother, breaks less and looks and feels really healthy. I do get bleach blonde highlights and my last appointment in June the hair dresser kinda fried my hair. It was shedding more breaking crazy easily and the ends were so dried out. I‚Äôve been trying to nourish it and repair it since then. I‚Äôve consistently used this vitamin for a whole month and I want to say I started to see and feel substantial results between 2-3 weeks. My hair started feeling silkier, it was breaking and shedding less (especially in the shower) and now a month in my hair looks and feels so healthy. I can‚Äôt rave enough about this vitamin or recommend it more!. Original:. This supplement has a unique kinda of texture to it. It feels firm when removed from the bottle but it chews and dissolves well. It doesn‚Äôt have a terrible vitamin taste to it but it also doesn‚Äôt have a fruity or sweet taste either. The taste is tolerable and fades after the gummy dissolves.. I love that this set includes 2 bottles to really be able to start to see the effects of the product. Now, I‚Äôve only been taking this for a couple days so, I know my review is a premature for results. I have very long hair that has been brittle and dry since my last hair appointment in June so I‚Äôm hoping this vitamin will help. I will be planning to update my review after the first bottle to note any changes and hopefully improvements I will see after a month of continued use.. I‚Äôll also say this set comes with a LOVELY large glass nail file that works incredibly well. I didn‚Äôt realize this set came with a nail file but, so far I am very happy with the bonus nail file gift.",5

2972,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,2022-10-30,Wayne,Awesome Biotin Supplement - Hair Skin & Nails,"I have been on a biotin supplement regime for years. I have thinning hair and brittle nails. I try different supplements for my source of Biotin whenever I run out. These were impressive and quite tasty.. As mentioned, I have been on a biotin regime for years, and my only expectation of this product was to maintain the results I had already earned after years of Biotin use. These met my needs and I am pleased with the product.. If you are new to Biotin, you are not going to have amazing results in a month or two months of use. You need to give a Biotin regime a good six months to see impact. Your existing nails for example, need to grow out and you will get to the strong hard nails gown while you were on the Biotin. Your skin needs to purge the bad (hence why you may be getting breakouts). Keep with it - they will go away and you will be ecstatic with the results.",5

This pack comes with two bottles of bears. You simply take two a day. You also receive a cool glass nail file gift in the box. I have been taking them for a short while and the thing I most notice is my nails actually growing faster and healthier. My hair is recovering from postpartum blah-ness. I think I won‚Äôt notice a difference there quite as quickly however I have noticed I‚Äôm shedding hair less when I shower. I assume it‚Äôs the vitamin at this point as it started a bit after I began taking these. Sugar bear seems to be a reputable and popular name in the vita world and honestly I see why. I can‚Äôt find much to say that isn‚Äôt wonderful thus far! I can‚Äôt wait to see how my hair continues to recover with these sweet bears.",5

3217,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2020-11-20,Leo Pham,It Works For Male Pattern Baldness!,"NOTE: We orderes ours directly from the manufacturer.. Long story short, I've tried a lot of biotin supplements, and SugarBearHair was the only one that made my hair come back! Forget those hormone-altering drugs, expensive implants, and whatever gimmick is out there.. I started losing my hair around 25, and by 29, I was ready to live with the buzzcut. I was already cutting my hair as short as possible, when my GF told me to try these. I was skeptical at first, because it looked like it was meant for women. But I had nothing else to lose, so why not! Was my bald going to get more bald!?. My hair just looked horrible when it got long, and trying to cover things up by growing it out wasn't an option anymore. You know it is beyond saving when your hair feels soft, as my hairline got worse it started feeling more and more airy/soft/smooth.. I honestly never believed these would even work. I thought it would be like all the other ""hair/skin/nail"" supplements... Junk. I chewed through all sorts of stuff, and the only thing that changed was how much money was left in my bank. I wish I had taken a picture before starting this regimen. But the photos started after I had finished my first bottle, so I don't have a record of how bad my hair originally was because I was a little ashamed of it, then I snapped a new one after every following bottle.. Some side-effects I noticed happening:. 1. My nails got really hard, thick, and had a shine to them.. 2. The vitamins affected all the other hair as well, it grows longer and thicker, like on my shoulders/nose/back. The hair on my face grows faster too, but it didnt get thicker.. 3. Skin feels a little more oily than normal.. Overall, if you've lost your hair due to MPB and are considering implants or drugs, give these a try first! I noticed a difference after just one bottle, so before taking more drastic measures, grab a bottle for $30 and see what happens. It is cheaper and less messy than Rogaine, that's for sure!. But one question I have is, what would happen if I stopped taking them? Would my hair go away again, or is it permanent.",5
3218,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,2018-07-26,ssyamada,Go for it! You won‚Äôt regret it!,"I know a lot of people claim that hair vitamins (or in some cases any vitamins) don‚Äôt work & are just a gimmick, but it took me three to four times as long to reach this amount of hair growth without @sugarbearhair ...with #sugarbearhair , my hair looks and feels stronger & grows so much faster that I‚Äôm not afraid to get my hair cut because I know it‚Äôll grow back pretty quickly if I don‚Äôt like it. And that first picture...it had taken two months for my hair to grow out that tiny little bit. I‚Äôm telling you, for me, this stuff works! #sugarbearhairresults I‚Äôve posted about them before, but it‚Äôd been over a year since I‚Äôd taken a break from them...after a less than pleasant hair experience, I‚Äôd decided to give them a try again & I‚Äôm so glad I did! If you‚Äôre on the fence about this product #goforit. If you‚Äôre up for reading more, lol: The backstory is that I‚Äôd tried SugarBearHair vitamins a couple of years ago after having tried to grow my hair out for a year due to a very bad decision on my part to get bangs & a short haircut, lol. They worked so well that my hair grew several inches faster than without them & I was able to do the braids again I‚Äôve become known for among my family & friends! It was so refreshing to be able to do more with my hair & I decided to add fun unicorn colors to the mix! I had a newfound sense of adventure with my hair because I knew it would grow quickly if I was ever unhappy with a cut or color again. It was great! And my boyfriend reveled in the fact that I was no longer constantly complaining about my hair, lol. So, I finished my 6 months supply and when it came time to renew I had other things to pay for and decided to take a break from the vitamins...I also decided at that time to stop bleaching my hair and let it grow back healthy & without damage. Fast forward a year and I got a bad haircut AND the stylist bleached every bit of new hair growth when I didn‚Äôt agree to it (I didn‚Äôt realize it was bleach until it was already on my hair...I thought it was color...). After two months of my hair barely growing 1/4 to 1/2 an inch, I decided to invest in SugarBearHair vitamins again and I am sooooooo glad I did!!! My hair has grown several inches! I‚Äôd estimate about three or four times as fast! Not only that, but my nails are stronger, my complexion is clearer, and My hair falls out waaaaaaaayyyyyy less so it‚Äôs thicker and fuller, which makes for awesome braids! ;) I hope you‚Äôre having a fantastic day!¬†And again, if you‚Äôre on the fence about this product, just go for it; you won‚Äôt regret it.",5

3220,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,2021-08-30,Tomoko,"Don't believe ""led to a doctor's visit""","There is a highly upvoted review that says ""led to a doctor's visit"" and it seems to claim that her doctor said that high dose biotin commonly leads to thyroid issues. THIS IS A MISCOMMUNICATION. I looked it up, and high dose biotin is known to affect the TEST RESULTS, not your actual thyroid.. Here's a quote from a clinical journal that I read as I was researching it: ""There are numerous reports of biotin interference with laboratory testing, specifically with thyroid function tests. Most commonly, biotin use can result in falsely high levels of T4 and T3 and falsely low levels of TSH, leading to either a wrong diagnosis of hyperthyroidism or that the thyroid hormone dose is too high."". When I read that person's review, I was like damn, that's intense. But it's not actually true (at least, not the way she said it, which is the confusing part). I hope you'll upvote this review so that other people know! Because yes, these vitamins work :) like all high dose biotin supplements do. These ones just taste good and have other great vitamins, like vitamin D.. There are known side effects of heavy biotin usage, like skin rashes, so just be careful and listen to your body. Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin which means your body gets rid of what it doesn't need through, um, your urine - whereas fat-soluble vitamins are stored in your liver and potentially lead to serious problems. So high doses of water-soluble vitamins like this are less risky. But again, do your own research, listen to your body, and don't believe everything you read, including my own review! :)",5

When I went to my hairdresser after I started taking it, I think she was skeptical, but when I returned for a trim 6 weeks later she said ‚Äú What did you say you were taking‚Äù. She was amazed at my new hair growth. My hair has never been thicker and at 70 years young, I am extremely happy. I have shared the news with anyone that will listen. God Bless Marcia",5

I had several bald spots around my temples and at the crown of my head. I've always had really thick & full hair so when all of these things started happening at once, it was a huge wake-up call for me to get healthy. My dermatologist cleared my scalp infections and I stayed away from perms, dyes, and heat for a few months. During that period, my neighbor recommended (SugarBearHair Vitamins). I started taking them periodically at the first of the year and I noticed a significant change almost instantly. My hair started to getting thicker and the bald spots started to fill in. Once I saw the changes taking on I really got energized to do better by my hair. Now, I take my (SugarBearHair Vitamins) everyday! I don't have to wear wigs or weaves anymore because my hair is on trajectory to pass 16in on it's own... possibly before Christmas.. I highly recommend this product because:. I didn't have any issues taking the gummies.. They taste like candy.. I didn't feel sick or have an irritable stomach like some other vitamins will do.. I saw an immediate change in hair strength and fullness.. My hair isn't falling out or shedding outside of normal tangles.. NO more wigs & weaves.. I can style my own hair in a ponytail.. My hair is actually growing..... I haven't been able to say that in years!. This product works!!. (This is my first and only product review and I am not a bot or a paid advertiser.). Good Luck!",5

I never write reviews but I am blown away by the results so I needed to say something. I picked this up, at check out, at a local cosmetic store. I had no plans to buy this but on a whim I did. I didn‚Äôt think it would work but I had heard about it for a couple of years from influencers on Instagram and didn‚Äôt think it was much more than a money making venture for the Instagramers. Well since it was there while I was checking out, I bought it. Maybe it‚Äôs coincidence, I don‚Äôt know, but I noticed within 24 hours my nails were much longer than they were before. I say this because my nails never grow. I never think ‚Äúwow my nails feel longer‚Äù because unless I am pregnant, I never notice a difference. Sounds so crazy right? But my nails are longer. I never have to cut them unless i‚Äôm pregnant and I haven‚Äôt been pregnant in a couple of years (not pregnant now). I noticed a little bit of visible hair growth because I did retouch my roots on Thursday (4 days ago) but i‚Äôm amazed at how well this product works. I can‚Äôt give a long term review since I have only been taking them for 4 days, but I am a little in awe of the results from 4 days that I had to make a review somewhere and I buy most stuff from amazon. The most significant change I can tell is in my nails, but I see regrowth on my freshly dyed hair too. My hair wnd nails grow insanly slow, but I mainly brought this product for my hair.. Hopefully the results will continue.",5

I‚Äôve got long hair and I cut it last March, it‚Äôs hard to manage it and going to the salon for another treatment will cost a lot. Anyways, I did loads of treatment and colors ended up a damaged hair. It‚Äôs not easy growing your long hair again, but that might change it. The importance is that I‚Äôm giving my hair a proper care it‚Äôs needed aside from choosing the right shampoo and conditioner. I know that it also needed from within. My hair can‚Äôt be more happier from getting all the benefits this gummies can give. h. Taking them twice daily my hair feels great and soft that's no joke! 2 weeks with the gummies, I barely having hair breakage or fall outs, did I say it is soft? Because I keep telling my husband to touch my hair.. I miss my long hair so I'm letting it grow and I know as it grows it will be more healthier that's for sure. I know this tasty gummy bears is literally for hair but let me add something. The benefits of these vitamins helps my nails a lot too, they don't break anymore, I'm pretty amaze about it!

However, I saw someone describe a thyroid issue due to these vitamins and that is a highly false accusation. I am on Synthroid for my thyroid. The fact of the matter is, biotin use can result in the falsification of high levels of T4 and T3 on a CBC. It could also falsify low levels of TSH, leading to either a wrong diagnosis of hyperthyroidism or that the thyroid hormone dose is too high. This could lead to a misdiagnosis of Graves Disease. This goes for any vitamin/hair vitamin... It‚Äôs a general rule of thumb and only to be discussed with your DR. Not to be blamed on a company. This product works wonders when used as directed.",5

After taking these vitamins for three months (because nothing improves overnight) here's what's happened:. - I no longer have problem dry skin on my scalp, it's all gone. Completely.. - I had a bald spot on my hairline, it has now completely grown back.. - (weirdly enough and not related to hair at all) I had ridges in my finger nails, my nails are now smooth as glass and a pretty/clean white color on the top. Not to mention, I have to cut my nails once a week now because they grow THAT fast.. -My hair grows 5x faster than it ever has. I would say maybe two inches in one month. That is incredible for me.... -My hair is shiner and healthier than it has EVER been. I don't have to put any cream in it anymore, just shampoo and conditioner and it looks amazing when it dries..

I don't get as many knots and I feel like it is getting fuller. I hardly straighten my hair, but when I did in the past it was always brittle, I thought it was heat damage which would have been weird since I hardly use heat. But I straightened it after 3 weeks on sugar bear hair and it's so soft and smooth like it should be. My hair wasn't damaged, it was just dry and sugar bear hair changed that.. I've also noticed a big change in nail growth and a little in nail strength. I have anemia so once my nails get a certain length, they break AND peel off. I've never had long nails because of that.

3527,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2021-08-25,Viridian Tide,"Let's talk about hair growth, acne and product discoloration","HAIR GROWTH - So first of all ... this stuff actually does help with my hair growth. I typically have a difficult time growing my hair (it's slow AF) but these vitamins have accelerated my growth significantly with just 1 bottle. I'm almost on my 2nd bottle now and I've seen perhaps an inch of growth this last month where I would normally only see a quarter to a half an inch.. ACNE- many people say that this product gave them cystic acne. I am not one of those people but I suspect those who suffer from this side effect have a biotin sensitivity. These vitamins (while they somehow work better for me than any other supplement) have about the same amount of biotin as most other hair supplements. So if you don't have an acne reaction with other hair growth vitamins, go ahead and give these a try.. DISCOLORATION - there are people in these reviews that claim the vitamins are fake because some receive bottles with a darker colored gummy - almost a greenish color. I was really bummed to see that I did in fact receive the greenish color rather than the light blue. I still took them and they worked beautifully, but just to be sure I wasn't scammed, I ordered a second bottle straight from the sugar bear hair website. My 2nd bottle is identical to the greenish ones I got from Amazon; both are well within their expiration dates. I would have to guess that the varying color may be due to heat conditions during shipping or possibly a product blend change from the manufacturer. I don't know. But they DO work for me where countless others have failed and I will continue to order them.",5

I received the bottles on January 30th so it's only been a week and 4 days at HALF the recommended dose. My skin isn't breaking out but I'm not sure if it's due to drinking half a gallon of water per day since biotin is water soluble, or because I'm on acne medication but it's helping my hair growth tremendously. Shaved my hair for cancer donation and it's already growing back and filling in so fast. It's also gone from medium brown to dark brown but that may be genetics. Overall, I'm VERY satisfied with the results do far. :) UPDATE: These photos were taken a month from the original post w/time stamps to show proof. In total, 3 1/4"" growth. I pulled the rest behind my ear to show comparison to length in first photo with ear length. No breakouts so far but I now drink a full gallon of water a day so that may help.

3714,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,2022-04-03,FruityPebbles,Yes it does work!,"Yes it does work, but you need to be patient.. I think people need to manage their expectations, don‚Äôt use Sugar Bear Hair vitamins for one month and expect to see miracle results that might work for some but don‚Äôt reject the product because this hasn‚Äôt worked for you. With most vitamins like this you need to be taking the product for at least 3 months before you can see a result, 6 months is more ideal in my view.. I‚Äôve been waiting a long time to write this review because I think you need to do so to be able to give an informed opinion. I‚Äôve been taking Sugar Bear Hair for around 18 months and what I have experienced is the following:-. Hair growth from shoulder length hair to full bra strap length and I expect my hair to be at the middle of my back within the next few months.. Hair thickness, my hair was thin and see through before, it no longer is.. Texture change, the texture of my hair has noticeable changed, it‚Äôs beautifully silky but it also has a coarseness to it to make it look full and heavy.. I can‚Äôt put this ALL down to Sugar Bear Hair, I‚Äôve been steadily improving my diet and taking in green powders also, so these things combined have contributed to my my progression. I also take excellent care of my hair, use all salon products, these also help.. Just some thing that I have noted from other reviews:-. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt stop hair fall‚Äù. Well no vitamin is going to stop hair fall/shedding. Shedding hair is normal and it happens to everyone. However excessive hair shedding is not normal and should be checked out by a clinician to rule out any medical issues.. What I will say is you need to take plenty of water with these. Significant water in take - I feel, will really enhance the efficacy of the product.. It is very expensive, but I find I don‚Äôt need to use anything else, just this and my green powders are doing the trick for me.. I expect my hair to be at waist length next year; not bad for someone who could not get their hair past shoulder length before.",5

Then dye it seven times in five months. Eventually it got to my shoulders but was so knotty even after I would brush it I had to cut it once more to just past my shoulders and dyed it orange.. I love long hair and miss it a tremendous amount as it was my identity and because of my hair's coarse, curly texture I find that in order to keep it healthy I need to cut it often which stalls the growth process. So I decided to give this a chance and will never look back!. It has been a month now since I've started taking these vitamins and nearly seven weeks since my hair cut, by which time my hair would be wiry, dry, and snapping off, but it's not! My hair has grown back to how it was before I cut it, and is so healthy I might be able to get another month in before cutting it again, which I hope will be the case so that I can get my waist length locks back!. I have never been so happy with the results of hair growth vitamins and I am buying my next bottle! I advise people to get this if you want your hair to be healthy!",5

I know everyone has different skin types, different hair types etc. but I truly believe these vitamins work so well for me. I have previously taken hairburst which also worked but wasn't as exciting to take. I genuinely look forward to taking these every morning, they taste gooooood!. I noticed another review stating that the Biotin in these will cause acne for sensitive skin and yes that is true, they CAN cause acne... I already have acne and I believe these did affect my skin, I did start getting quite painful spots on a daily basis. I wouldn't let this put you off trying them, if you have a break out just stop using them!. I had my hair coloured right as I started taking this vitamin which has acted as a fantastic indicator for how quickly it's growing. My roots are making me anxious.. I have had to take a break from these to let my skin settle down which is an absolute shame, I just wish they were cheaper (I have tried cheaper alternatives from Tesco but saw no results whatsoever).

Back around Halloween I cut my hair and the stylist cut off way too much and it was literally chin length. I hated it and wanted to quickly grow it out a bit so I decided to buy these after all of the reviews. I wish I had pictures but I never took any. My hair has grown so much faster than it normally does. In the last 3 months I‚Äôve had at least 5 or 6 inches of growth, and normally I only see maybe half an inch a month. My hair isn‚Äôt where it was before, but it‚Äôs definitely long enough for me to be happy with it now. The only downside is the fact that these make you break out. My face is mostly ok but my back is NOT! So I will likely stop taking these after I finish my 3rd bottle.",4

I had been taking these since 2020, and my hair has grown significantly in that time after a full decade of trying everything else to get it to grow out. As other reviews have mentioned, the new formula does not taste nearly as good as the previous one, and I noticed that the ingredients have changed and contain less of certain vitamins. They're also much harder to chew now. I would forgive that all, but for the first time since starting these, my skin is breaking out like crazy now, and I have never had acne-prone skin. I tried eliminating different skin products in search of a culprit, but I realize now it must be the new gummies. I will be switching to another brand immediately.",4

Ever since then, I've been trying every hair product out there targeted to 'repair' damaged hair, stop breakage, and overall restore your hair. I've been taking biotin for a few months now and have noticed that my nails are longer and a lot stronger, but I haven't seen much growth or improvement with my hair so I decided to look for something made specifically for the hair. I saw a ton of Intstagram posts about this product and the Tiffany blue color got me, so I decided I would give them a go.. The taste: these gummies are seriously the most delicious gummies I've had. Sometimes I wish I could take more than two.They kind of stick to your teeth, though. But it's not a big deal.. The first day I took them, I started bloating up and my face started getting bigger, too. Not sure why. But just a couple days in, I was already seeing improvement. Sadly, I started to break out like crazy. Now, I seldom get pimples or blemishes on my face. So it was a little discouraging when I saw that I was getting pimples. A new pimple would pop up every day and I considered putting a pause on the gummies as I began to have acne marks. My face still bloats up a bit from taking these and I am still getting pimples, but I am in the second week of taking these so I'm still hopeful that these side-effects are temporary from my body still adjusting to them.. My hair felt so much softer less than one week in. Its appearance was already improving, too! It was not dry, coarse, or brittle anymore (I am also using a cleansing conditioner and hair lotion) and I noticed that my hair was already drastically shinier, tamed, and soft. My hair is FINALLY on the road to recovery!. Though I am experiencing breakouts and face-bloat, I am definitely going to keep taking these as this is the only thing that has worked for me so far. I definitely recommend this product to anyone experience hair breakage/damaged hair. These seriously changed my (hair's) life!",4

A month later and my hairdresser says she sees a few new baby hairs coming out. Did these help? I don't know. My physician said hair growth would return naturally, just may take longer.

Not all skins are the same so you may have to try them for yourself to see what effect it will have on you. I however have always battled with acne and had finally had it under control for almost a year now with curology. Within a week of taking these gummies my skin flared. I thought I would finish the month before deciding if I would buy them again or not and what kind of review I would give. Plus at 30 dollars a bottle I was going to get my money‚Äôs worth. I am now two days from finishing the bottle and still have the bad flared up acne.

Cult-worshipping friend swore by the holy Kanye that it worked. And my stress has been so bad, my dye jobs so severe, my hormones so out of whack, that desperation drove me to purchase. And so I took these little blue candies, two per day, for a month. And to my dismay, they began to work. My hair wasn't falling out as much in the shower, even my nails were seemingly growing back. Lies, Kanye, lies, I shouted, wallet tossed across the room. So I went back to CVS-brand biotin. My progress had reversed, and my hair started being wonky again. When I gave back in, having read a buzzfeed article about how sugar bear hair has about 2x all the crud they state on the label, I made a compromise with myself. Only 1 gummy per day, along with a strong multivitamin routine and good diet. I think that's where I'll stay. It actually... works.. Update: Sugarbear still works. I'm still stressed and sick and it keeps my hair from falling out in heaping clumps. That saves my sanity, because chronic illness sucks enough. However, this price is steep, considering I'm only taking 1/day and can stretch this two months...32 bucks a month for hair vitamins is absurd. Can y'all, seeing as I know you're popular as all creation right now, adjust prices? It's not sustainable.",4

I would say in two months my hair is two inches longer, but I unfortunately forgot to take a before picture. My favorite parts though are definitely the shine and just the overall health of my hair. I've noticed much less hair falling out while in the shower and less breakage after wearing a ponytail for an extended period of time.. Now for the side effects. While I do not have the acne issues noted by some, I do notice more hair growth......everywhere. I've never noticed the peach fuzz on my face before, but I definitely do now!

But, it's definitely affecting my skin. I was hesitant to buy these because of some of the reviews talking about these vitamins making them breakout, but I decided to give them a shot. Just a couple days into taking this, I started to develop cystic acne in places I never breakout, such as the middle of my chin and the center of my cheeks. It's usually only one big bump I'm dealing with at a time, but they take forever to go away. I'm hoping the cystic acne is just a early side-effect, as a result of something like ""purging"" and goes away quickly, as some claim. I'm also going to try to drink more water, because that could definitely be the issue. But, as a real person who wants my hair to grow desperately, I want to warn everyone that the cystic acne reviews are not to be taken lately. I'll update after continued use!.

I really liked the taste and the balance of vitamins within them, but I was struggling with the price. Especially since you have to take two a day. After 2 bottles, I decided to try another brand that was similar from Target, and I immediately regretted it. These taste like gummies you would eat as a child, and the store bought ones were awful tasting. I also thought that I was saving money by purchasing a cheaper brand at the store, but the instructions said that you should take 3 of those a day. When I did the math, the prices ended up being comparable.. I definitely noticed a change in my hair and nail regrowth after taking these vitamins for a few months. They are my #1 choice for biotin related vitamins. The only issue I have is with the price.

4319,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,2016-05-24,Ketoinchi,They are delicious and great - if you are REALISTIC!,"After reading all of the reviews I felt the need to leave my own in order to clarify a few things. I ordered a 3 month supply and just started my second month on SugarBearHair. I think the mistake that a lot of people make is that they expect a MIRACLE vitamin. Unfortunately, hair does not grow inches overnight (or even in a few weeks for that matter). In a nutshell, this company takes all of the good, hair beneficial vitamins and puts them in delicious, easy-to-eat gummies. Can you go to the store and purchase the ingredients (Biotin, etc.) separately for cheaper? Definitely. But these are about having all of the healthy hair benefits in ONE bottle without the nasty taste that other vitamins/supplements have. I have struggled with consistent substantial shedding for awhile now so I wanted to give these a try. I hate swallowing pills- especially the ones that have a bad taste, so these seemed right for me. So far I have NOT noticed a big difference...maybe some baby hairs growing near my temples, but they ARE convenient, delicious and very easy to take. As for the acne topic...I did break out a tiny bit when I first started taking these but I honestly don't know if it was from the sudden influx of Biotin or an external source. I don't have sensitive skin but I guess it's a risk you take if you do. Mine cleared up very quickly. I will update my review after I finish my 3 month supply.",4

As someone who has struggled with cystic acne for most of my late 20s, I wasnt about to spend money on a three month supply that messed up my finally (somewhat) managed skin. Now that I've been taking it twice a day as the bottle suggests, I can honestly say it has not caused any breakouts. I'm not trying to say that some of these reviews are lies but I've seriously struggled with acne and this has not done anything to make my skin worse, or better for that matter.. So if you're like me and you're worried about some of these reviews with break outs then do what I did and just get one month first to make sure it doesnt affect you first.... However, I can't say I notice a huge change in hairless yet or new hair growth but I'll give it more time. I am ordering month two-five.",4

I can see some root grow out (probably over a half an inch), and my hair ends seem to be longer smoother. I've also been using a coconut oil leave in conditioner once or twice a week.

I'm not going to say this is going to work for everyone who is willing to try it because it won't.

4373,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2019-07-08,BkChanel,"Not worth the hype. Review is long, but worth the read","I‚Äôm a AA with 4A/4B hair texture. I‚Äôve taken hair, skin, and nail vitamins and other vitamins in the past, but I prefer the gummies because they are more convenient to take. I was previously take Nature‚Äôs Bound (check the name ) strawberry, but I didn‚Äôt really see a difference. I searched the internet and these had great reviews. I took these a few months ago in December and purchased some for my sister, she had positive feedback. At that time, I didn‚Äôt really see a difference, but it was only one month. So starting June of this year, I took the vitamins consistently, in fact, I only missed two days of dosage and that was very early on. So, I purchased some for July. Well, lately I‚Äôve been noticing a few things, but the only thing that has changed for me is the vitamin intake.. 1. I pee a lot, I mean a lot. At first I thought it was my increased water intake, but even when I don‚Äôt drink as much or I stop drinking several hours before bed and void my system, I‚Äôm waking up at least one time, sometimes two times a night. I remember hearing about if your body doesn‚Äôt need something it eliminates it, I‚Äôm thinking with the excessive amounts of vitamins (more than likely biotin (see below for why I think why )) my body is eliminating it.. 2. I have box braids in, I‚Äôve had box braids in since I started the vitamins. I do believe my hair has grown a lot, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the vitamins. The reason why, when I have box braids in and I‚Äôm using JBCO and wild growth oil, my hair grows out faster. I‚Äôve also added rice water to the mix and deep condition every two weeks. Again, I can‚Äôt say the vitamins didn‚Äôt help at all, but (see next point ) but consider everything else I‚Äôm doing and results in the past, it‚Äôs hard to believe it‚Äôs from the vitamins.. 3. My nails haven‚Äôt changed, my skin has experience a few minor breakouts. I‚Äôm 30, so the days of teenage acne, thankfully is long gone. However, around my menstrual I still experience hormonal acne and when I‚Äôm stressed. I haven‚Äôt been stressed so much lately and I‚Äôm on a BC that eliminates my periods. Also, usually when I get acne or a few breakouts at this stage, it‚Äôs on my chin, well since taking these vitamins, I‚Äôve had acne on my forehead. Not much, just a bump here and there, which I haven‚Äôt had since I was a teenager, so this is huge for me. Also, my nails are still brittle . I‚Äôve taken Hairfinity years ago and the first thing I noticed was my nails improving. My nails never had an issue growing long, but staying strong, they always are brittle. About two months before taking the vitamins, I decided not to do anything to my nails, just try and file them and keep them healthy. Well, my nails are still brittle . Not saying the vitamins were supposed to change that, but I would have hoped to see some benefits with my hair(which is still up for debate just a tiny bit) , skin, or nails .. 4. This is probably the most important factor, my vitamin levels are still low. I understand that sometimes when you are on these types of vitamins you can have false positive with blood vitamin test and other blood test, but this isn‚Äôt my case. I recently went to the doctor and received a blood panel. I‚Äôve been having some other issues as well as feeling fatigue. Guess what, I have vitamin d deficiency, I‚Äôm not surprised my dad has it, and I avoid the sun like the plague now, I live in Florida. My vitamin D levels are low, I‚Äôm on a regimen for 12 weeks (most people do 6-8 weeks and go to just taking calcium ). Also, I failed to tell my doctor I was taking the hair, skin, and nail vitamins, but after getting these results, and others she told me to take a multi vitamin and take one with iron. I‚Äôm not a doctor, but here are my thoughts , the vitamins contain a daily dosage of vitamin d, I know with a deficiency it‚Äôs possible that the vitamins did help me some in this area and I was just still low. But for her to look at my overall results and still recommend that I take a multi vitamin, is a little alarming. Again, I understand that this is NOT a multi vitamin, but I would have just thought that I would be receiving a sufficient amount of the vitamins stated in the bottle , maybe my body did not simply adjust.. This review is not to bash the vitamins, but just my experience. I‚Äôm going to stop taking them. If nothing changes, I‚Äôll take the review down (meaning I found out my issues were related to something else ). I‚Äôve read tons of positive reviews about the vitamins, so I‚Äôm praying they were all accurate and I‚Äôm a rare case, however I will be reading in my $30 vitamins for some that are half the price that includes iron and less things that I don‚Äôt need. Disclaimer: I know that these are not miracle pills and these things usually only help people who are experiencing a shortage of vitamins from their diet, but I would encourage you that if you have any concern see a doctor and receive accurate info about what vitamins you need. If you can‚Äôt see a doctor, start with an OTC (over the counter ) vitamin that‚Äôs half the cost, look into other things for nail and skin health, and tea and eat healthier",3

This is the longest my hair has been since I was a teenager and I have cut it 3 times this year to get the old bleached dead ends off. And I cut off 2-3 inches each time.. It is now past my tatas, which was my goal and have never been able to do it without extensions! So very happy about that.. 3. You will notice hair growth everywhere‚Ä¶ and I mean everywhere. I have to shave my legs almost everyday now but I‚Äôll take it if my hair stays long and healthy!!. 4. The only thing that bothers me is the bottle says 60 vitamins and it‚Äôs always one short.

4387,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2019-06-23,AyaPup,Minor breakouts so far. Why is there sugar in this product?,"I have been taking these for a little over a week. I have already noticed I am not losing as much hair when I brush and wash it. It is making me break out in white heads and small pimples. I also started taking vitamin B5 at the same time. Vitamin B5 helps to stop Biotin from creating acne breakouts. The bears I have been taking twice a day and the B5 once a day so I am going to increase it to twice a day as well to see if that helps control breakouts. I have acne prone skin and I figured that this product would make me break out, but my hair has been growing much slower than usual now that I no longer bleach it (coloring or bleaching the hair can make it grow faster from the scalp as the chemicals help to stop fungal issues and buildup which slows down hair growth), so for me it was worth a shot. I'm not giving up on the bears yet and am going to try a more diligent skin care routine along with increasing my b5 dosage. If the acne gets worse or can't be controlled by changing my routine, I will sadly have to discontinue use.. I get that it is called sugar bear hair, and that sugar is pretty much put in everything these days, but with all of the alternatives out there along with the fact that bitoin can cause breakouts already, having sugar as an ingredient doesn't make a lot of sense. I break out from sugar as well so it would be nice to have a truly healthy gummy and if they included Vitamin b5 as an ingredient to help negate the skin effects of Biotin. I commend them for making a gummy that is free from artificial ingredients at least. I hope the company can consider a healthy sugar free alternative, as a lot of people are unable to tolerate sugar.",3
4388,-1,0,0,-1,0,0,0,2017-06-24,Amazon Customer,Now this is a Instagram famous brand and I'm pretty skeptical of hair pills in general and I've tried ...,Okay so I received this product incredibly fast so I'm giving it 5 stars for shipping. Now this is a Instagram famous brand and I'm pretty skeptical of hair pills in general and I've tried a bunch. Now these are pretty damn expensive vitamins. Like compared to other vitamins that contain way more in the bottle and contain way more vitamins and nutrients these are pretty mediocre and overhyped. Now that being said I bought these because if you're on a journey to grow out your hair and have ever tried any brand of hair skin and nails vitamins you know those vitamins are big AF and smell horrible! Sometimes they mess up your tummy too if you eat them without a meal. So that's where I think these gummies win they smell really good ( like Hubba Bubba tape actually) and taste even better like a sweet berry flavor. I personally after buying other brands fall off the wagon when it comes to taking them everyday so the benefits are lost but these are so sweet and fun to take I won't forget. I also should mention buzzfeed did a video on these and got a lab to test them. They received and A grade from the independent lab but they found that if you took more than 2 a day you'd be consuming excessive amounts of lead so keep these away from children because they straight up look like candy. They also found that these contained more biotin then what's on the bottle. Take that for what you will.. I think if you have no problem taking pills everyday then there are cheaper options that contain more vitamins. Hell I think a gummy multivitamin would be the same as this if not better. Really what you're paying for is the novelty and cuteness of the item. If the price is right with you I think these are a great option.. Also a lot of people experience breakouts when taking biotin. If you find yourself breaking out drink more water alongside the supplements and I would only take half of the recommended serving so one bear a day and see if that helps.,3

4392,1,0,-1,0,0,1,0,2020-02-02,Esther Kwon,Works but does give you acne,I have been taking sugar bear hair for almost a year now and I used to really love it. I took 2 a day everyday as suggested by the bottle. They taste great and are easy to chew. I'm asian and I have long black hair and I have been bleaching my hair blonde for a few years now. A year ago I accidently let the bleach sit in my hair too long and experienced some breakage and more damage than usual. I started taking these gummies to help me with my hair and I think they work ok. My hair has been growing out nicely and my nails feel a little stronger too. I thought they were too expensive but I got them anyway because they were delicious and any help for my hair doesn't hurt. I started to notice about 2 months ago that I've started getting a lot of acne on my scalp. I didn't think too much about it but recently wondered if it was due to the gummies. I stopped taking the gummies and suddenly no new acne. I think if you keep taking them for a long time you do start to get acne. I have been subscribed to getting a bottle a month and have no canceled it. I have a bottle and a half left over and I will probably take one gummy once in a while until it's gone. But honestly I don't think you need it but if you have the money go for it but maybe take 1 every few days and not everyday.,3

It helped Woth my nails alotttt more than my hair. I was so excited because I‚Äôm Muslim and these were the only gummies I could find that were halal and then that‚Äôs when it hit me! I started getting acne with this and tbh at first I ignored it thinking maybe it‚Äôs just hormonal acne acting up but then I started seeing a new pimple every single day. So I decided to test it and I stopped taking them for 2 weeks and my face cleared up. Now I do have friends who take these vitamins and they work great and don‚Äôt cause acne on them. I guess it just depends on your body and your acne. I have cystic acne and it didn‚Äôt match well with that. The flavor may seem really sweet and soft but it was more sour then sweet but they were still very delicious. My hair didn‚Äôt get thick with this but it did prevent it from more fall out then before. Hope this helped,3

I can say that these definitely worked. I saw a big difference in my nails which were weak and damaged from too many gel manicures. They grew in long and strong within a week.. My hair never grew any faster but it did start to produce more oils and looked healthier but over time it was too oily and I needed to wash it often. After the second month I was no longer able to prevent breaking out. I also gained a little weight which I hear others have had a problem with on excess biotin..

4851,-1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,2022-10-02,Zen*Yogi*Girl,Weird taste and texture that is hard to get past,Baffled at the popularity of these because they are not very pleasant at all! They have the texture of checking gum that has been chewed and left to set and a weird taste that can be best described as when you get ice that is from a machine that is not very clean and has a weird sulphur taste - mixed with some kind of overly fruity flavor. Once I got that chewing gum thing in my mind it was had to overcome.. They are also priced extraordinarily high and yes they do have many extra vitamins than a traditional biotin gummy - I prefer to take a daily multivitamin that has everything I need and not have my biotin mixed with a bunch more as your body can only absorb so many vitamins anyways.. That said you do get 2 months supply in this pack so that together with the 15 key vitamins and minerals might make this a good buy for someone that does not take any other supplements.. As for claims about hair and nail growth - yes biotin can help but the results are individual for everyone and vitamins are not subject to FDA regulations so it will be a matter of try them and see if they work for you !. They are okay but I cannot get past the taste and texture.,3

I received this as a gift for my birthday in January and I just finished the bottle about a week ago. While I do see scalp growth for my hair and the hair overall grows faster, I don‚Äôt necessarily see it as healthier? I have a lot of flyaways and breakage still. My hair is died a light brown so the dark brown hair growing in is having breakage as well. My nails I see no improvement and my skin has a lot of breakouts along my chin and forehead. I‚Äôve also had a few ingrown hairs around the hairline. I‚Äôve also notice I have persistently gotten in grown hairs in my armpits with the rapid hair growth, currently I have 3 in one arm and one in the other arm. Not sure if this is from the gummies but this has never been a problem before.. The taste of the product over all is good the size is manageable.

4855,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,2019-03-11,JesusSaves,Not noticeable enough compared to other biotin gummies,I took a before and after 3 months picture. Took the gummies like clockwork. I didn't notice much difference in growth of my hair but I did notice I started breaking out. üòï I had high hopes for a big change because of all the great reviews.. Positives: one pack came with two extra gummies. The gummies taste amazing!!! The texture is like a starburst but better flavor.. Negatives: So much sugar it made me break out. Cost is too high.. Neutral: My hair did grow over the 3 months but not noticeably more than normal.. I trimmed my hair once during the 3 months but only half an inch. So my hair grew maybe an inch. My hair is dry in the before picture and wet in the after so my wet hair hangs a little longer. Total growth I'd say is an inch....at most an inch and a half in 3 months.. I'm taking Vitafusion extra strength Biotin gummies now that I ran out of these. Texture is about the same and has a delicious blueberry flavor. Sugars are 3g. I'll update this with results from those after 3 months for comparison.,3

I took these vitamins for 2 months and watched my originally clear skin break out worse and worse. I didn't want to believe it was from the gummies and went to my dermatologist who told me to immediately stop taking them. He told me it's pretty common for people to get breakouts and acne from biotin and that the form and amount of biotin can make a difference.I switched back to just the pill form of biotin and my skin started improving right away. While I noticed my hair grew faster(twice as fast as usual) the gummies didn't help with my brittle hair and the scars on my face are still noticeable. I would definitely suggest if you're going to try them just take one a day.,3

I don't dye my hair hair, don't put heat on it since I wear it natural, and I trim it twice a year. My hair before taking these has normal thickness, but I have a lot of fallout, and it has always been shiny and has a lot of elasticity even without product. So within this one month period I haven't seen much change with that. And my hair length has always stopped growing at my nipple, so that's the main reason why I tried these supplements, but still in the one month period haven't seen any change in that either. And for my nails, my nails have always been super long and strong so I haven't seen a difference in that. It didn't give me any breakouts taking them so that's good, and they taste delicious, even when I normally hate eating anything that has gelatin consistency, but I would eat the whole bottle if I could.

I didn't experience crazy breakouts like some people reported, but I use Proactive products so that may have helped.. I did experience some digestive changes however. Apparently my body doesn't respond well to heightened levels of biotin because I gain weight every time. I eat healthily and exercise 4-5 times a week and I gained about 3 lbs while taking these vitamins.. I gave it a 2/5 because the gummies at least taste good.. Overall, is the product bad?

Well this reported that it had way more biotin than it claimed which is the culprit of breakouts from taking supplements.. I was halfway through my first month and my face erupted with large, painful nodule acne. I have stopped taking the supplement so this will clear up, I was worried this would happen when I saw that lab rating.. It did seem to help my hair somewhat. But it's not worth the breakouts. They included pantothenic acid which is supposed to help balance out the biotin, but if there is more of that than they report having in the gummies it's not going to make a difference.

I just ordered these a week ago and have been taking them as instructed on the bottle. I‚Äôve noticed my hair, in general, is softer and has a little more shine than normal. My nails are noticeably less brittle, as well. But my skin is OILY AF! I was on accutane as young adult and haven‚Äôt had acne in YEARS. I usually struggle with dry/combination skin in fact. I‚Äôve developed large pores and small bumps on my cheeks/forehead that didn‚Äôt exist prior to me taking the vitamins. Nothing has changed in my diet or skin care routine, except for these gummies.

5304,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2021-02-23,R.R.Pauli,Overpriced Fad,"These are an overpriced gummy vitamin. The Kardashians are not registered dietitians, I have never seen their show, but am aware now that their endorsement is how these things became so popular; not because the product itself works well enough to charge this much for them. If you want to look like a Kardashian, save your money by buying a different supplement, take the money you saved, and go see a cosmetic surgeon: that‚Äôs their secret. Not their products and not this stuff. An Expert Witness does not mean someone who has seen a cosmetic surgeon, gets a service from them, and is on TV and chronicles their life of toxic drama. That doesn‚Äôt make you a registered dietitian or a dermatologist or a cosmetic surgeon. The cosmetic surgeon might also have better recommendations for other products that actually work. There are other supplements out there for around $9.99 that do the same thing this does. It‚Äôs a pointless fad for the price. This is a placebo effect if people are willing to spend this kind of money for so little. When I bought it, I saw the high reviews, didn‚Äôt do my research on why this item was so popular, and did not look at the amount. I incorrectly assumed that for the price - I would be receiving a fair amount, an amount that would make it competitive with other products that are the exact same thing. I was a little taken back by the small size and amount when I received it. That‚Äôs when I did my research. This is popular because of a ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù endorsement; not because it works better. A simple celebrity couldn‚Äôt possibly speak to it‚Äôs effectiveness; only an expert witness and properly conducted research would be able to speak to that. Anything short of that should be labeled false advertising. We live in a world where we are falling behind in our STEM, particularly when it comes to women in the STEM. This product demonstrates that and does so while taking your lunch money right from under your nose. Don‚Äôt buy it: return it if you did.",1

Another thing I noticed is when I had my hair recently colored my hair fried which is something new as well. I‚Äôve changed nothing in my diet and my hair dresser used the same products she‚Äôs been using for years. Even she couldn‚Äôt understand what happened..

Imagine taking something to make you feel better and you end up feeling worse and insecure too.

I attributed it to poor posture from working from home. Funny thing is is for a week and a half I spent time trying to heal my back. It wasn‚Äôt my back that was the problem it was my left kidney. I took two of these as instructed per day. I am now sitting here writing to tell you this product is NOT safe and it clearly says has not been approved by the FDA. I woke up this morning with a brownish colored urine and knew right away it was my kidneys and not my back muscles. The amount of biotin in this product is not a normal amount for your kidneys to ‚Äúpee‚Äù and ‚Äúfilter‚Äù out. It‚Äôs way above it. Through the stratosphere above it. So if you find yourself taking these and suddenly your back hurts guess what? You just paid $30 for an extremely expensive hospital visit. I would not recommend these to anyone. They are unsafe and there is NO WARNING label on the ‚Äúvitamins.‚Äù Talk to your dr and show him or her how much biotin is in it and they will tell you how unsafe it is. It will damage your body,1

Nothing dramatic, my ponytail just isn't as full as it used to be. I wanted to try taking a vitamin to see if I could promote some hair growth. I have taken biotin before and didn't notice much of a difference at the time but I thought it was worth another shot. I figured that these would be just as good as any other biotin supplement with the added bonus of being cute and tasting good.. Well, they do taste good but that's about where the positives stop for me. Almost immediately I started breaking out in cystic acne, but I knew that was a potential side effect and I was willing to deal with some acne if it meant getting more hair. However, literally within a week of starting this supplement as directed my hair has begun falling out in CLUMPS. I know how much hair loss in the shower is normal for me, and I am losing outrageously more than I ever have before. I can't even run my fingers through my hair without pulling out handfuls. I am absolutely devastated and I am 100% sure that this product is to blame - nothing else about my haircare or nutrition routine has changed.
