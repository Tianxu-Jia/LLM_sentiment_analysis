A family friend who went to cosmetology school, and hair school, recommended these to me after I told her that ever since I cut my hair super short in college I feel like my hair doesn’t grow pst a certain length anymore. I started taking these and my lashes are fuller and my brows are fuller! Best of all my hair is literally noticeably longer than it ever has been other than when I was a little girl. I didn’t want to believe it but it works. I will note that I have a sensitivity to biotin, but most HSN type of vitamins have biotin in them. Because of this I have the tendency to break out when taking anything with it as an incredibly even in the smallest amount. This is something I never was looking to “sacrifice” with other vitamins because they didn’t show much results and I would break out quite a bit, even on my back (I NEVER break out there). My break outs while taking sugar bear were not the worst, but I was getting more than one which I never do. I use a pretty consistent routine that otherwise leaves my skin pretty clear so I feel like I notice everything on my face. Will be repurchasing !\""
