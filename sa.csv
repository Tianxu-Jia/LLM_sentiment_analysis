0,"I have been taking these gummies (along with their women‚Äôs multi vitamin) religiously for 3.5 weeks now. There isn‚Äôt a drastic difference yet, but I am seeing improvements and plan to wait a full 3 months for best results like others have mentioned.. For my background, I am a healthy 30 year old woman. No history of medical issues (aside from occasional low iron which I take vitamins for as well). 7 months ago I had COVID for about 8 days. I lost my taste and smell like most other people but that was about it. Fast forward about 3 months later, I started to notice that I was losing more hair every time I would shower (which is daily for my oily hair). It wasn‚Äôt large clumps at a time but it was definitely more than the usual 5-10 strands that I was used to. I thought at first that this was stress-related since I‚Äôve had a lot going on lately but then I started to notice that my hair texture had drastically changed to being thin and lifeless and the crown of my head and hair-part were really thin. I could see my scalp when I have never been able to see that before which started to scare me. By month 6 I was looking up every option to help.. At the beginning of May I started using the following:. - I take 2 of these vitamins once a day at night (both the hair vitamins and womens multi vitamin). - I kept up with my routine of taking iron pills because I‚Äôm anemic (this can also affect hair growth so I made sure to keep up with this - but DO NOT take iron supplements if you don‚Äôt need it as this can cause health problems for someone that doesn‚Äôt need iron supplements). -I started using Nioxin hair treatments (2% minoxidil topical treatments twice per day, massaged into my scalp in the morning and at night). - I started using Nioxin shampoo and conditioner every day. - and I started to use Redken extreme length sealer cream as a styling leave in conditioner before blow drying my hair. (All products mentioned are pictured with this review). After 3.5 weeks of this strict routine, I am starting to notice a difference and hope for continued growth. I will say, I am unsure which product is doing the trick for me but I am keeping up with the routine regardless because I am desperate for my old hair back.. Note: it‚Äôs worth mentioning that I‚Äôve been told that once you start a topical solution like Nioxin, you‚Äôll have to keep up with it otherwise your hair will start to fall out again like it did originally. It shouldn‚Äôt cause additional fallout, but it will essentially go back to where you started from what I‚Äôve heard. I‚Äôm not sure if this is a marketing scheme or if it‚Äôs true, so I‚Äôm just incorporating it into my routine from here on out- it‚Äôs honestly not that inconvenient once you‚Äôre used to it. Also if using any Minoxidil topical solution, be careful when applying the solution that you don‚Äôt get it on your face-unless you want facial hair.. I hope to post an update in 2 or 3 months. Thanks for reading my long review (sorry!) and good luck to anyone else going through this.. ***5-MONTH UPDATE*** I have been eating these gummies every night for 5 months now. I am happy to say that I have seen significant hair growth and my hair is much thicker again (no more bald spots on top of my head either). I stopped using the Nioxin after about 2 months of my routine because my hairline improved quickly and I wanted to see if I could take away that treatment and keep my results. Now, I am only taking the vitamins and my hair has grown about 6 inches in 5 months! My hair usually grows slow so this was a big deal for me. I also noticed that my nails are so much stronger than before, and my eyelashes seem to be thicker as well (I didn‚Äôt start to notice these benefits until about month 3 or 4 though). I haven‚Äôt had any skin issues like some people have posted, but everyone is different. I hope to continue these vitamins for the next 6‚Äì7 months and then I plan to provide a 1-year updated review.", Positive
1,"They are a little expensive, but they seem to work. I'm on my 3rd bottle. I took first bottle thinking I'll try it... who knows. I didn't really see a difference at first.. I sit in my chair and have a habit of running my fingers through my hair getting rid of tangles when I am on the phone. Usually every time I end up having about 10-15 stands come out every time I comb through my hair with my hands to the point I was getting very concerned! Then shower after and as I'm shampooing and conditioning more would come out in my hands. Plus, I'd need to clear the drain several times to get water to drain and even after shower and after water had all drained go back and clear the rest of the hair out of drain.. I've always had very thick hair. I keep it below shoulders but above or at bra strap range.. So back to the first bottle. I had been taking them every day, and I was nearing 3 week and trying to decide if I should order another bottle and had decided not to waste the money. A few days later, I was chatting on the phone with my mom and running my fingers through my hair... like I do, and noticed only 2-3 strands of hair in my fingers each time. I was shocked. I kept running my hands through my hair and sometimes only 1 strand or none. I took a shower, least amount of hair in my drain than I've seen in a very long time!. So I ordered my second btl.. I wasn't as diligent about taking it daily and with this stay at home order where I live, different from shelter in place orders other states have, I got a little down and at a time where I should be upping all my supplement intake to keep my immune system healthy, I got down and wasn't taking much of anything.. I started noticing handfuls of hair coming out each time again. So I started back on my gummies about 2 week's ago and put in my order for my next bottle and received it yesterday.. So I haven't noticed thicker hair yet, but my hair didn't get down to half its thickness in just a month. It took a year and a half to really get thin.. I will say that it's already started slowing down the hairs I lose every time I run my fingers through it.. I did notice that my scalp is less visible when I'm styling it ( that I noticed after the first month I started taking them).. Biotin and folic acid are very important to hair and growth. But what is also important to know is B vitamins work together. So this product contains 5B vitamins (B6,B9,B12,B7, and B5).. The only thing I wish they would remove is the blue coloring. I usually attempt to stay away from food colorings. I mean who cares what color it is as long as it works. Plus I prefer not to have extra toxic ingredients, and I would love if they added all the B vitamins.. I'm going to finish my second bottle and start my third with no long gaps this time to see how things go, but in the interim I'm also going to look for a good liquid B complex as well.. Just a side note if you didn't already glean this little tidbit of knowledge from my long winded review, when you stop taking these you will go back to losing your hair.. It's not a one time quick fix! However, that is with everything in life. You stop eating junk food for a month, you feel great and lose weight and have more energy and are healthier for those changes and choices made. You go back to eating junk and you go back to where you were before.. Any healthy changes you choose to make in your life you will need to continue in order to keep seeing results.. I hope this helps anyone that has a bit of time on their hands to read it. üòÅ. Clearly I had a bit of extra time on my hands to write it considering most of us are staying at home until we can return to work.", Positive
2,"For so long I never bought these because I didn‚Äôt want to support the kardashians financially since they promoted it often, however now years later, I tried it and I love it. A family friend who went to cosmetology school, and hair school, recommended these to me after I told her that ever since I cut my hair super short in college I feel like my hair doesn‚Äôt grow pst a certain length anymore. I started taking these and my lashes are fuller and my brows are fuller! Best of all my hair is literally noticeably longer than it ever has been other than when I was a little girl. I didn‚Äôt want to believe it but it works. I will note that I have a sensitivity to biotin, but most HSN type of vitamins have biotin in them. Because of this I have the tendency to break out when taking anything with it as an incredibly even in the smallest amount. This is something I never was looking to ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù with other vitamins because they didn‚Äôt show much results and I would break out quite a bit, even on my back (I NEVER break out there). My break outs while taking sugar bear were not the worst, but I was getting more than one which I never do. I use a pretty consistent routine that otherwise leaves my skin pretty clear so I feel like I notice everything on my face. Will be repurchasing !", Positive
3,"Mi comentario positivo no es por que me hayan dado $. D√©jenme decirles que es muy bueno a mi se me ca√≠a mucho pelo y es que tengo bastante pero cada vez al ba√±arme un un manojo en la tina y una semana despu√©s de tomar estas ya no se me car igual podr√≠a decir lo normal en caerse, lo malo de estas gomitas es que es demasiado caro para mi presupuesto. Pero de verdad lo recomiendo", Positive
4,I have tried this product a few times over the years and it always helps. I have only consistently taken it for a month or two and always seen dramatic hair growth. No breakouts and no weird side effects. Highly recommend it!, Positive
5,"As a professional hairstylist I have tried so many hair growth products it's unreal. Within 30 days I noticed lengthy baby hairs in bang area, around ears and nape area! 60 days I had to bobby pin my bang area.... This is the best hair growth products in the market!!! So glad I found them", Positive
6,I‚Äôve had these before and I could see the difference in my hair! The products were fine when they arrived!, Positive
7,"I love these vitamins!. I lost a lot of my hair after having covid. A friend told me about these vitamins. I started taking them and noticed a huge difference in about a 1.5 month time frame. Not only did they help my hair, but they help clear my skin from acne as well.", positive
8,"They are easy to chew, and i actually got alot of new hair growth", Positive
9,These are amazing! And they taste great which is an extra bonus., Positive
10,"I just received this vitamin on 2/12/23. This is not my first time buying these ones. But this time I saw the colour differ I thought maybe a new type, once I opened the bottle it has a terrible smell, I still tried. Omg the taste is so disgusting, made me throw up. I called Amazon costumer service, complained about it , thx they refunded me and I ended up trashing this one.. I will order but not now", Negative
11,"Now I was really skeptical about buying this product but I have tried everything to make my hair grow back. I had full thick curly hair now my hair is really thin and I lose clumps of hair. I have three bald spots and I have noticed since taking this product hair has begin to grow and this is the second time I order it, so I‚Äôve been taking this for six months now it does help your nails for me and my case it took a little longer for the hair, but I am now seeing results for my hair to grow back", Positive

14,"I've been taking sugar bear hair for a long time. I got a bottle and noticed that the gummies were darker than usual. The consistency was weird and my wife noticed that her hair was falling out even more. On our most recent order, we tested the gummies and they were the original sugar bears. They were like what they are supposed to be. The bottom on the left is the correct bottle while the bottle on right is the fake bottle. The bottle itself on the fake bottle is also different.", negative
15,"I first saw these gummies all over my social media feed, I was interested but thought it was a overhyped product, especially when I saw the Kardashians advertising it. I‚Äôm an African American female who joined the natural hair community over 2 years ago. My hair texture is kinky coily 4C and wouldn‚Äôt grow past a certain length even with protective styles and natural oils. January 2018, I purchased these vitamins after doing my research and reading the reviews on here. I also changed my diet, eating more leafy greens and drinking more water and focused on skincare to avoid breaking out. I was shocked when I started seeing results after two weeks, not only was my hair growing longer, the sparse areas in my edges grew back and I had new hair growing around my hair line pushing it forward. My nails also grew and hairs on the other parts of my body both wanted and unwanted lol. My sister is my hair stylist and she too noticed my hair growth but convinced me it was my new diet and healthy lifestyle rather than the gummies, so I stopped taking them after February. Unfortunately, my hair stopped growing, my edges started getting sparse and my nails were not as strong. After 3 months with no progress, I repurchased the Sugar Bear Hair Gummies in June. I‚Äôm writing this review a month later and MY HAIR IS GROWING AGAIN!! This time I did have some break outs pop up during the first week but they went away and I haven‚Äôt had anymore show up. The only con I have is the price, almost $40 a month is adds up but I recommend you try it out. Sorry for the long review.", Positive
16,I took them for a month and I see a difference in my hair .., Positive
17,"These gummies taste fantastic! I quit taking them for awhile, hoping to find something of equal value, while stilll providing the same great taste and giving healing power to not only my hair, but also my skin and nails. WOW! This is it! I HAD to go back. After only TWO days back on them, I honestly experienced the most improvement in my skin over any other product I tried.. I recently pulled out a partially used bottle of Sugarbearhairhair vegan gummies because I had been noticing more-than-normal drying and flaking skin and hair and started using the gummies for just a couple of days when I noticed a drastic change in the smoothness and improvement in the feel and look of not only my hair, but of my nails and skin as well. I looked at the label on the Sugarbearhair gummies and read that the daily value of 260mcg (2 gummies) contains 108% folic acid! Now that is amazing! That was enough evidence for me to demonstrate the reason for the rapid improvement in the texture, look and feel of my hair, nails AND SKIN!. I recently completed a form at the doctor's office for a Medicare wellness exam and one of the questions on the forms asked if the patient (me) takes Folic Acid as a supplement. I looked at the bottle of Sugarbearhair gummies and read the label that stated 108% value in Folic Acid. I'm not really certain about how to interpret these values but it was enough", Positive

21,"My fingernails are the strongest and longest they have been in years after less than a month of taking this product! As for my hair, some is still falling out but I think it is less than before and there does seem to be a number of short hairs mixed in with it too. I has my hair cut 2 weeks ago, and I am already close to needing a trim. Usually I need a trim every 6 weeks, so this is a good thing because the short hairs I am seeing would be right at the stage of new hair growth. I am one happy customer!", Positive
22,"I had Covid middle of last year and it made my hair fall out for months afterwards. Within just a short period of taking these, my hair stopped falling out and started growing again. These helped me so much!!!", Positive
23,"I will have to come back in 3 months to update my review. For now I give it 5 stars based on taste, ease of taking and ingredients. I won‚Äôt review based on results until I‚Äôve tried it at least 90 days. No one can really give an accurate review of a product like this for a few months. Taste: they are yummy. Can‚Äôt complain about that at all. Best part about the flavor is once you‚Äôre finished chewing & swallowing, the flavor pretty much goes away. It‚Äôs not a lingering flavor.. Ease of taking: yes, they are easy to chew. Very soft. Not rubbery like a gummy bear. However, they do tend to stick to your teeth. It‚Äôs not that bad. They dissolve fairly quickly so it‚Äôs very little that sticks.. Ingredients: It‚Äôs full of all the vitamins needed for healthy hair, skin, nails. Nothing to complain about there. For those that do complain about a couple of the extra ingredients like sugar & coloring, please stop. It‚Äôs not enough to make a difference. The gummies are small, and you only chew two daily. FYI.. #1 do NOT contain enough sugar to cause acne. Think about the other things you consume that contain before you blame the vitamins. #2 Please do a little research on the difference between micrograms (mcg) and grams (g). The Inositol is dosed in mcg on this label. It‚Äôs not even close to enough daily to cause a real problem. I think some people could have sensitivities to things, but I also believe the pics shown of people with massive acne breakouts are from people with acne prone skin anyway. I do not have acne on my face. I will be able to give an honest review of the product, if that should change. I doubt it will. Like I said the ‚Äúother‚Äù ingredients like sugar & inositol are not enough to CAUSE severe acne breakouts.. I will be back to update in May!. P.S. I had already been doing other things for my hair prior to starting the gummies. I wash my hair in a quality moroccan oil shampoo & conditioner and I use an argan oil heat protectant spray on my hair before using ANY heating tool whether it‚Äôs a hair dryer, straightener or curler. I threw away my brushes and ONLY use a comb. I don‚Äôt put my hair up wet. I don‚Äôt box color my hair anymore. In fact, I don‚Äôt dye my hair at all. I get it cut every 8 weeks. Once a week I use an argan oil mask. Once a month I use a vinegar rinse (Just Natural). Yep, I spend a lot of money, but the products last forever. My hair is healthier than it‚Äôs ever been. The gunmies were the final step. Oh, and I drink a ton of water. I do that anyway because I workout daily. I eat no sugar, no fried foods, no processed foods. You HAVE to take care of the inside as well as the outside of your body.", Positive
24,Great product, positive
25,"I've ALWAYS had these little bumps on the back of my arms and dry skin in general. I started taking these for my hair, I didn't expect the amazing skin results! The bumps are completly gone and for the first time ever i have soft skin (and its a dry winter!!) My husband even commented on how nice my skin is. It's also helping my hair. It doesn't feel so fine and is getting stronger.", Positive
26,I have been taking Sugarbear Vitamins for a while. Recently they changed the formula and the taste is not nearly the same. I used to recommend these based on results and great taste but the change of formula really has me re-thinking if I like these anymore.. I‚Äôm not sure why they changed the formula? Can someone from the company explain?. Thanks, Negative
27,"I was losing a lot of hair, and this has helped me a lot.", Positive
28,"There's something funny with these vitamins. For instance, color. They have a slight brown yellow tinge. They don't smell like the original vitamins, and they have me under the skin pimples. I have never had issues with acne with these supplements before, BUT, this is my first time ordering from Amazon. It makes me question if these are genuine sugar bear hair supplements. It's also a bit questionable that they do not honor a return policy. BUYER BEWARE.. I ordered some new ones from the actual website and will update you ladies and gents with photos so you can compare notes. Thank you.", Negative
29,"First off, I never review products, and I would have never imagined myself to have such rave reviews for adult gummy vitamins. But I figured that as a 22-year old woman who has dealt with hair loss and thinning at the part for a majority of her teenage and young adult life, my experience with this product may be worth sharing. After a parent was diagnosed with a chronic illness when I was a teenager, stress and hair loss (and stress because of hair loss, etc.) had become a normal part of my life. Countless doctor appointments, hair specialist visits and blood tests had ruled out the possibilities of allergic reactions, genetic disorders, and hormonal imbalances. It wasn't until my general practitioner finally mentioned that the causes were likely stress and nutrition-related that I started doing research into vitamins to treat my deficiencies, and boy, am I glad I did. Soon after, I came across SugarBearHair--which I recognized from the plethora of promotions made by the Kardashian clan and other celebrities--and quite frankly, I was skeptical about its legitimacy. But by this point, I was at my wits end after years of treatments and finding no real results, so I figured I would give this a try for at least one month.... I am not exaggerating when I say that the results have been FANTASTIC. In the last month, I have received comments from my hairstylist, hair loss specialist and family about my hair regrowth. My hair looks fuller now than it has in years, with thick hair regrowth on the back of my head. I can also see my thinning part beginning to slowly fill out. To say that I am RELIEVED AND ASTONISHED would be an UNDERSTATEMENT. It should also be noted that I am using this product in combination with other vitamins, Spironolactone and birth control pills targeted at preventing hair loss, as well as better managing my stress, sleep, exercise and diet. However, it is also worth mentioning that it wasn't until a few weeks AFTER I started taking SugarBear that I starting seeing real results. I just started bottle two, and I don't intend to stop. Fingers crossed the results will keep coming. To all the young ladies out there experiencing hair thinning: PLEASE PLEASE 1) manage your stress, diet, sleep, and overall health; and 2) TAKE YOUR GUMMIES!", positive

34,"I have never written a review for any of the hundreds of times I‚Äôve bought through amazon prime over the last three years but I absolutely had to give this product some props. I‚Äôve had naturally curly, very thick hair, and super strong, fast-growing nails my entire life, always have gotten compliments on my hair and my nails and as silly as it sounds, wished my hair was thinner because it was SO much to deal with. As I‚Äôve gotten older (I‚Äôm 30 at the time of writing this) my hair has thinned out. After my second child was born almost seven months ago.. My hormones took over and my hairline was visually receding like a grown man‚Äôs. My fingernails were never affected and have remained strong and beautiful, but my face and scalp dried out extremely bad and my hair was just falling out excessively. I couldn‚Äôt put my hair up anymore and did everything I could to hide my bald spots. I cried everyday. My doctor told me eventually my hair should start growing back but it takes time. I‚Äôve had friends who have had this problem and their hair NEVER grew back so I was mortified remembering how little hair my grandma had when she died at age 65. I was hesitant on trying these because I‚Äôve heard gummy vitamins don‚Äôt absorb as well but I was willing to try anything to get my hair back. It‚Äôs a 6 week difference between these pics. My nails never took a hit but they‚Äôre growing even faster than normal and even my skin dryness has improved a little. My main concern was my hair. My hair has not grown this fast since I was a kid and it no longer looks like I‚Äôm balding. The proof is in the pics and I‚Äôve had multiple friends order now just from seeing my results.", Positive
35,Love Sugarbear for my hair. I have been using this product for about 3 years they are easy to take.Love them..

37,"I've been using this product for the last 3+ months since late September. After an incident with swimming in my pool with dyed hair, half my hair was falling out! Hair dye and swimming DO NOT MIX. My hair used to be down to my stomach, after the chemical mishap, it went up to my shoulders, I cried every night in bed. I was skeptical about buying these, there was almost a point where I thought about shaving my head because I was that desperate to get my length back. These were my last resort and OMG, these were absolutely life savers! I'm not to say these are magical gummies, results take time, patience and consistency. Along with my recovery, I did adapt to a hair care routine and took safety precautions such as washing my hair 1-2x a week, sleeping with a satin bonnet every night, applying detangler/leave in spray conditioner after washing my hair, not wrapping your hair in a towel, not using a hair dryer, applying hair growth biotin to my scalp to boost the results. I take photos of my hair growth every month, within the 1st month, my hair was healthier, softer and stronger, after 3 months, I do see a huge difference in length. I'm glad I purchased these, I was so desperate to regain my length. Along with a hair care routine, these gummies will give you reasonable results.

39,"I never write reviews for anything but the fact this is the one vitamin that I have noticed results from..I just have to let all of you know that rather than help grow my hair (which is actually true).. it has caused my skin to be extremely smooth. I have always been prone to breakouts.. I've been on accutane twice, proactive for years and just recently I started getting facials just for maintenance purposes. I always used to have little pimples on my forehead and then some on my neck and near my temples.. but it just depended on the week..some weeks were way better than others for my skin... people who get regular acne will understand what I mean. After being on accutane.. my skin become gorgeous..both times it lasted for about a year and then I would begin to have break outs again. I would go tanning in tanning beds just to try to dry out the pimples or it would just make my face darker which I felt hid my acne..(it actually just was damaging my skin even more and causing me more oily breakouts)..as much as I knew tanning was awful for me.. it was the one thing that I felt helped( although it really didn't!) I started taking sugar bear hair two months ago.. I can't say my skin was awful before taking them because it wasn't.. it wasnt great either.. but ever since I began taking these delicious gummies.. I swear I rarely get a pimple!!! My forehead I so smooth and clear along with the rest of my face. Bottom line.. these things are delicious.. I would eat a handful if I could. I figured they were just a fluke ad that everyone posts on instagram.. but I'm telling you.. it really works. I have longer hair to start but I have noticed stronger and thinker hair. I mainly take them for my skin now that I have found out how amazing they are. I read reviews of people saying that you shouldn't take them if you have acne prone skin but believe me ..everyone is different.. it might just work for you like it has for me!", Positive
40,"I have very thin hair and recently got a haircut whete they cut wayyyyy too much length off, and my hairline isnt exactly desirable for being a man, within 3 weeks after taking these I noticed 3 big changes. 1. My hair got a lot thicker and fuller I couldnt really tell if it grew faster or not but im satisfied with the length as well. 2. Hair that stopped growing 3 years ago started growing again, this I did not expect! Very happy with this. 3. The reviews that write about acne as a side effect are spot on, I never get acne but after taking these I noticed my face started getting dry skin and a few spots of acne breakouts, its totally managable though because after 2 days of a moisturizer that went away. It started coming back again so im going to have to use the product again to treat it. If you want your hair to grow thicker and your front hairline to possibly grow back again I highly reccomend these. The tradeoff for thicker hair for manageable acne is definitely worth it imo. Just get acbe treatment in advance.", Positive

Slightly fuller, my hair is almost shoulder length I wear it in ponytail, I am 71 yrs young. I used to take other kind but I didnt like too chewy & I'm allergic to red food dye color. It recommends 2 a day I take 1, I have been out now 2 wks so I gotta order again before I start shedding like my 3 cats, that is one thing I noticed, my hair is not falling out when I comb it after shower. Not sure what is in these but im convinced they work, I will take 2 next time, however I would like them to be a lil less expensive, especially since im on Soc Sec. Hey can we have Sr Citizen discount pls I will take these forever at my age my hair is important, my hair is white/lite grey I get compliments on how shiny it is, I'd rather be blonde like I used to be about 3 yrs ago yes I literally went grey overnite, shock sold house, moved, cat died, separated, uncertainty about everything. So shedding hair is one thing I dont want, life is stressful enough.", Positive
45,"I am the last one to give anything a good review for no reason. So believe me when I say with all honesty, I just finished my first bottle (I got the 3 month supply because your system doesnt take some time to adjust and if you want something that works and lasts, you will never get anything that will give you what you want over night.. I have literally tried EVERHTHING. Straight biotin and more.. But for starters, first off my nails have never grown this evenly, quickly or have ever been this strong. Ever. My family are the toughest cridicts and even they noticed (whaaaa) lol. Second, I have daily extream anxiety and stress and to be honest I am not a stranger to depression, so when my hair got as thin as it was I really thought there was something wrong with me... After a slight change in diet (just eating a little better) and taking this, ONE MONTH my hair is 2 inches longer and is looking healthier. It used to take a few months for it to grow an inch and a half.. It got really bad.. So my suggestion to you. If you want this to work, you should also try taking a bit better care of yourself on the insides. Most vitamins and supplements WONT WORK if your body can't process them. Learned this the hard LOOOONG way as well.. I reccomend it, and wish you all the best.", Positive
46,"I have a lot to say about these. I bought them to help my hair grow. I have been taking these vitamins for about 6/7 weeks. Which means I am on my second bottle and I also think I now have a solid review:. PROS:. 1) The taste is AWESOME! They are very soft and delicious, like a fruity gummy snack. Honestly hard to eat just the recommended 2!. 2) My nails have never been stronger. They grow insanely fast and do not break (maybe a tiny tear in a corner but nothing a nail file cant fix) I must also add that I am very rough on my nails. They are also shiny and the tips are very opaque and white (normally the tips of my nails are flimsy and see through). 3) My hair seems to be growing faster. I can usually get away with not coloring my roots for up to 8 weeks but right around 5 weeks it was looking BAD! I would say my normal hair grows just over 1/2 inch per month and now its growing 1/2 inch in about 3 weeks. My opinion is you will see results but nothing like the pictures you see on instagram where you see girls' hair growing 2 inches in a month.. CONS:. 1) Body hair will also grow faster. For some reason I think my armpit hair is growing the fastest lol but my eyebrows have also filled in more than usual (this can be a PRO for some ladies with sparse brows) I did not notice any improvement in eyelashes. 2) The price is a little high but I have never seen such great results for my nails from a vitamin so it might be worth it to some people.. Overall, great product. I think it delivers what it says it will deliver. Personally, I will try it for one more month and see if I get any substantial hair growth and if not I will no longer place future orders.", Positive
47,"My teen boy who had quite long hair got a haircut before school and was completely freaked out by how short it was. We looked up how fast hair grows and what to do to help. We measured carefully. He won't let me post pictures but his hair grew a solid inch or more in 6 weeks! Finger nails also grew fast, not a desired side effect for him but worth it. He is a very happy customer.", Positive
48,I‚Äôve been buying product for years and the bottle I purchased from Amazon in September 2022 tasted strange and the gummies also had a different tint of blue to them. Needles to say I immediately discarded them. When I received them the plastic seal on the top was still intact but I was comfortable consuming something that obviously had a problem at the manufacturer., Negative
49,I have been taking these vitamins for 5 months now in order to help grow my hair back after chemotherapy. My last chemo treatment was in early December 2021 and I started taking these vitamins right away. My hair has been growing back since around Christmas 2021 and is growing thick and fast. I am also really impressed by my nail growth and how healthy and strong they are! I work with my hands a lot and my nails are always cracking and breaking but not with these vitamins! It took me about 3-4 months to notice the difference it is making in my nails. I was considering switching to a cheaper brand but I will not be doing that., Positive
